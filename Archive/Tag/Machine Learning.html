<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>By training another type of model from the open source .NET library that I've been using and combining its results with the similarity model from last time (see <a href="/automating-suggested-related-posts-links-for-my-blog-posts">Automating &quot;suggested / related posts&quot; links for my blog posts</a>), I'm going to improve the automatically-generated &quot;you may be interested in&quot; links that I'm adding to my blog.</p>
<p>Improvement, in fact, sufficient such that I'll start displaying the machine-suggested links at the bottom of each post.</p>
<h3>Where I left off last time</h3>
<p>In my last post, I had trained a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastText">fastText</a> model (as part of the <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst">Catalyst .NET library</a>) by having it read all of my blog posts so that it could predict which posts were most likely to be similar to which other posts.</p>
<p>This came back with some excellent suggestions, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learning F# via some Machine Learning: The Single Layer Perceptron</strong><br />
How are barcodes read?? (Library-less image processing in C#)<br />
Writing F# to implement 'The Single Layer Perceptron'<br />
Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and AccordNET)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. but it also produced some less good selections, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Simple TypeScript type definitions for AMD modules</strong><br />
STA ApartmentState with ASP.Net MVC<br />
WCF with JSON (and nullable types)<br />
The joys of AutoMapper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still not discounting the idea that I might be able to improve the results by tweaking hyperparameters on the training model (such as epoch, negative sampling rate and dimensions) or maybe even changing how it processes the blog posts - eg. it's tackling the content as English language documents but there are large code segments in many of the posts and maybe that's confusing it; maybe removing the code samples before processing would give better results?</p>
<p>However, fiddling with those options and rebuilding over and over is a time-consuming process and there is no easy way to evaluate the &quot;goodness&quot; of the results - so I need to flick through them all myself and try to get a rough feel for whether I think the last run was an improvement or not.</p>
<h3>Introducing a new model</h3>
<p>The premise that I wil be experimenting with is to determine what words in my post titles are &quot;interesting&quot; and to then order the suggested-similar posts first by a score based upon how many interesting words they share <em>and then</em> by the similarity score that I already have.</p>
<p>The model that I'll be training for this is called &quot;TF-IDF&quot; or &quot;Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency&quot; and it looks at every word in every blog post and considers how many times that word appears in the document (the more often, the more likely that the document relates to the word) and how many times it appears across multiple documents (the more often, the more common and less &quot;specific&quot; it's likely to be).</p>
<p>For each blog post that I'm looking for similar posts to, I'll:</p>
<ol>
<li>take the words from its title</li>
<li>take the words from another post's title</li>
<li>add together all of the TF-IDF scores for words that appear in both titles (the higher the score for each word, the greater the relevance)</li>
<li>repeat until all other post titles have been compared</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking the example from above that didn't have particularly good similar-post recommendations, the words in its title will have the following scores:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Word</th>
<th>Score</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Simple</td>
<td>0.6618375</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TypeScript</td>
<td>4.39835453</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>type</td>
<td>0.7873714</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>definitions</td>
<td>2.60178781</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>for</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMD</td>
<td>3.81998682</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>modules</td>
<td>3.96386051</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>.. so it should be clear that any other titles that contain the word &quot;TypeScript&quot; will be given a boost.</p>
<p>This is by no means a perfect system as there will often be posts whose main topics are similar but whose titles are not. The example from earlier that fastText generated really good similar-post suggestions for is a great illustration of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learning F# via some Machine Learning: The Single Layer Perceptron</strong><br />
How are barcodes read?? (Library-less image processing in C#)<br />
Writing F# to implement 'The Single Layer Perceptron'<br />
Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and AccordNET)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of them are investigations into some form of machine learning or computer vision but the titles share very little in common. It's likely that the prediction quality of this one will actually suffer a little with the change I'm introducing but I'm looking for an overall improvement, across the entire blog. I'm also not looking for a perfect general solution, I'm trying to find something that works well for <em>my</em> data (again, bearing in mind that there is a relatively small quantity of it as there are only around 120 posts, which doesn't give the computer a huge amount of data to work from).</p>
<p><em>(It's also worth noting that the way I implement this in my blog is that I maintain two lists - the manually-curated list that I had before that had links for about a dozen posts and a machine-generated list; if there are manual links present then they will be displayed and the auto-generated ones will be hidden - so if I find that I have a particuarly awkward post where the machine can't find nice matches then I can always tidy it up myself by manually creating the related-post links for that post)</em></p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p><a href="/automating-suggested-related-posts-links-for-my-blog-posts">Last time</a>, I had code that was reading and parsing my blog posts into a &quot;postsWithDocuments&quot; list.</p>
<p>After training the fastText model, I'll train a TF-IDF model on all of the documents. I'll then go back round each document again, have this new model &quot;Process&quot; them and retrieve Frequency values for each word. These values allow for a score to be generated - since the scores depend upon how often a word appears in a given document, the scores will vary from one blog post to another and so I'm taking an average score for each distinct word.</p>
<p>(Confession: I'm not 100% sure that this averaging is the ideal approach here but it seems to be doing a good enough job and I'm only fiddling around with things, so <em>good enough</em> should be all that I need)</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Training TF-IDF model..&quot;);
var tfidf = new TFIDF(pipeline.Language, version: 0, tag: &quot;&quot;);
await tfidf.Train(postsWithDocuments.Select(postWithDocument =&gt; postWithDocument.Document));

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Getting average TF-IDF weights per word..&quot;);
var tokenValueTFIDF = new Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;float&gt;&gt;(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
foreach (var doc in postsWithDocuments.Select(postWithDocument =&gt; postWithDocument.Document))
{
    // Calling &quot;Process&quot; on the document updates data on the tokens within the document
    // (specifically, the token.Frequency value)
    tfidf.Process(doc);
    foreach (var sentence in doc)
    {
        foreach (var token in sentence)
        {
            if (!tokenValueTFIDF.TryGetValue(token.Value, out var freqs))
            {
                freqs = new();
                tokenValueTFIDF.Add(token.Value, freqs);
            }
            freqs.Add(token.Frequency);
        }
    }
}
var averagedTokenValueTFIDF = tokenValueTFIDF.ToDictionary(
    entry =&gt; entry.Key,
    entry =&gt; entry.Value.Average(), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase
);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, with a couple of helper methods:</p>
<pre><code>private static float GetProximityByTitleTFIDF(
    string similarPostTitle,
    HashSet&lt;string&gt; tokenValuesInInitialPostTitle,
    Dictionary&lt;string, float&gt; averagedTokenValueTFIDF,
    Pipeline pipeline)
{
    return GetAllTokensForText(similarPostTitle, pipeline)
        .Where(token =&gt; tokenValuesInInitialPostTitle.Contains(token.Value))
        .Sum(token =&gt;
        {
            var tfidfValue = averagedTokenValueTFIDF.TryGetValue(token.Value, out var score)
                ? score
                : 0;
            if (tfidfValue &lt;= 0)
            {
                // Ignore any tokens that report a negative impact (eg. punctuation or
                // really common words like &quot;in&quot;)
                return 0;
            }
            return tfidfValue;
        });
}

private static IEnumerable&lt;IToken&gt; GetAllTokensForText(string text, Pipeline pipeline)
{
    var doc = new Document(text, pipeline.Language);
    pipeline.ProcessSingle(doc);
    return doc.SelectMany(sentence =&gt; sentence);
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. it's possible, for any given post, to sort the titles of the other posts according to how many &quot;interesting&quot; words (and <em>how</em> &quot;interesting&quot; they are) they have in common like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Post 82 on my blog is &quot;Simple TypeScript type definitions for AMD modules&quot;
var post82 = postsWithDocuments.Select(p =&gt; p.Post).FirstOrDefault(p =&gt; p.ID == 82);
var title = post82.Title;

var tokenValuesInTitle =
    GetAllTokensForText(NormaliseSomeCommonTerms(title), pipeline)
        .Select(token =&gt; token.Value)
        .ToHashSet(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
		
var others = postsWithDocuments
    .Select(p =&gt; p.Post)
    .Where(p =&gt; p.ID != post82.ID)
    .Select(p =&gt; new
    {
        Post = p,
        ProximityByTitleTFIDF = GetProximityByTitleTFIDF(
            NormaliseSomeCommonTerms(p.Title),
            tokenValuesInTitle,
            averagedTokenValueTFIDF,
            pipeline
        )
    })
    .OrderByDescending(similarResult =&gt; similarResult.ProximityByTitleTFIDF);
	
foreach (var result in others)
    Console.WriteLine($&quot;{result.ProximityByTitleTFIDF:0.000} {result.Post.Title}&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The top 11 scores (after which, everything has a TF-IDF proximity score of zero) are these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7.183 Parsing TypeScript definitions (functional-ly.. ish)<br />
4.544 TypeScript State Machines<br />
4.544 Writing React components in TypeScript<br />

</blockquote>
<p>So the idea is to then use the fastText similarity score when deciding which of these matches is best.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of ways that these two scoring mechanisms could be combined - eg. I could take the 20 titles with the greatest TF-IDF proximity scores and then order them by similarity (ie. which results the fastText model thinks are best) or I could reverse it and take the 20 titles that fastText thought were best and <em>then</em> take the three with the greatest TF-IDF proximity scores from within those. For now, I'm using the simplest approach and ordering by the TF-IDF scores first and then by the fastText similarity model. So, from the above list, the 7.183-scoring post will be taken first and then 2 out of the 5 posts that have a TF-IDF score of 4.544 will be taken, according to which ones the fastText model thought were more similar.</p>
<p>Again, there are lots of things that could be tweaked and fiddled with - and I imagine that I will experiment with them at some point. The main problem is that I have enough data across my posts that it's tedious looking through the output to try to decide if I've improved things each time I make change but there <em>isn't</em> enough data that the algorithms have a huge pile of information to work on. Coupled with the fact that training takes a few minutes to run and I have recipe for frustration if I obsess too much about it. Right now, I'm happy enough with the suggestions and any that I want to manually override, I can do so easily.</p>
<h3>Trying the code yourself</h3>
<p>If you want to try out the code, you can find a complete sample in the &quot;SimilarityWithTitleTFIDF&quot; project in the solution of this repo: <a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/BlogPostSimilarity">BlogPostSimilarity</a>.</p>
<h3>Has it helped?</h3>
<p>Let's return to those examples that I started with.</p>
<p>Good suggestions from last time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learning F# via some Machine Learning: The Single Layer Perceptron</strong><br />
How are barcodes read?? (Library-less image processing in C#)<br />
Writing F# to implement 'The Single Layer Perceptron'<br />

</blockquote>
<p><em>Less</em> good suggestions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Simple TypeScript type definitions for AMD modules</strong><br />
STA ApartmentState with ASP.Net MVC<br />
WCF with JSON (and nullable types)<br />
The joys of AutoMapper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the not-very-good one has improved and has these offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Simple TypeScript type definitions for AMD modules</strong><br />
Parsing TypeScript definitions (functional-ly.. ish)<br />
TypeScript State Machines<br />
Writing a Brackets extension in TypeScript, in Brackets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. but, as I said before, the good suggestions are now not <em>as</em> good as they were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How are barcodes read?? (Library-less image processing in C#)</strong><br />
Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)<br />
Implementing F#-inspired &quot;with&quot; updates for immutable classes in C#<br />
A follow-up to &quot;Implementing F#-inspired 'with' updates in C#&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of suggestions that <em>are</em> still very good - eg.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>.. but still some less-good suggestions, like:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, having just looked through the matches to try to find any really awful suggestions, there aren't many that jump out at me. And, informal as that may be as a measure of success, I'm fairly happy with that!</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>Using the same open source .NET library as I did in my last post (<a href="/language-detection-and-wordsinsentence-classification-in-c-sharp">Language detection and words-in-sentence classification in C#</a>), I use some of its other machine learning capabilities to automatically generate &quot;you may also be interested in&quot; links to similar posts for any given post on this blog.</p>
<h3>The current &quot;You may also be interested in&quot; functionality</h3>
<p>This site has always had a way for me to link related posts together - for example, if you scroll to the bottom of &quot;<a href="/learning-f-sharp-via-some-machine-learning-the-single-layer-percepton">Learning F# via some Machine Learning: The Single Layer Perceptron</a>&quot; then it suggests a link to &quot;<a href="/face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet">Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)</a>&quot; on the basis that you might be super-excited into my fiddlings with computers being trained how to make decisions on their own. But there aren't many of these links because they're something that I have to maintain manually. Firstly, that means that I have to remember / consider every previous post and decide whether it might be worth linking to the new post that I've just finished writing and, secondly, I often just forget.</p>
<p>There are models in the <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst">Catalyst</a> library* that make this possible and so I thought that I would see whether I could train it with my blog post data and then incorporate the suggestions into the final content.</p>
<p>* <em>(Again, see my <a href="/language-detection-and-wordsinsentence-classification-in-c-sharp">last post</a> for more details on this library and a little blurb about my previous employers who are doing exciting things in the Enterprise Search space)</em></p>
<p>Specifically, I'll be using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastText">fastText</a> model that was published by <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText">Facebook's AI Research lab</a> in 2015 and then <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst/tree/master/Catalyst/src/Models/Embeddings/FastText">rewritten in C#</a> as part of the Catalyst library.</p>
<h3>Getting my blog post articles</h3>
<p>When I first launched my blog (just over a decade ago), I initially hosted it somewhere as an ASP.NET MVC application. Largely because I wanted to try my hand at writing an MVC app from scratch and fiddling with various settings, I think.. and partly because it felt like the &quot;natural&quot; thing to do, seeing as I was employed as a .NET Developer at the time!</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I had a single text file for each blog post and the filenames were of a particular format containing a unique post ID, date and time of publishing, whether it should appear in the &quot;Highlights&quot; column and any tags that should be associated with it. Like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1,2011,3,14,20,14,2,0,Immutability.txt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the very first post (it has ID 1), it was published on 2011-03-14 at 20:14:02 and it is not shown in the Highlights column (hence the final zero). It has a single tag of &quot;Immutability&quot;. Although it has a &quot;.txt&quot; extension, it's actually markdown content, so &quot;.md&quot; would have been more logical (the reason why I chose &quot;.txt&quot; over &quot;.md&quot; will likely remain forever lost in the mists of time!)</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I came across the project <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a> and thought that it was a cool idea and did some (perhaps slightly hacky) work to make things work as a static site (including pushing the search logic entirely to the client) as described in <a href="/the-neocities-challenge-aka-the-full-text-indexer-goes-clientside">The NeoCities Challenge!</a>.</p>
<p>Some <em>more</em> years later, GitHub Pages started supporting custom domains over HTTPS (in May 2018 according to <a href="https://github.blog/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/">this</a>) and so, having already moved web hosts once due to wildly inconsistent performance from the first provider, I decided to use this to-static-site logic and start publishing via GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>This is a long-winded way of saying that, although I publish my content these days as a static site, I write new content by running the original blog app locally and then turning it into static content later. Meaning that the original individual post files are available in the ASP.NET MVC Blog GitHub repo here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/Blog/tree/master/Blog/App_Data/Posts">github.com/ProductiveRage/Blog/tree/master/Blog/App_Data/Posts</a></p>
<p>Therefore, if you were sufficiently curious and wanted to play along at home, you can also access the original markdown files for my blog posts and see if you can reproduce my results.</p>
<p>Following shortly is some code to do just that. GitHub has an API that allows you to query folder contents and so we can get a list of blog post files without having to do anything arduous like clone the entire repo or trying to scrape the information from the site or even creating an authenticated API access application because GitHub allows us rate-limited non-authenticated access for free! Once we have the list of files, each will have a &quot;download_url&quot; that we can retrieve the raw content from.</p>
<p>To get the list of blog post files, you would call:</p>
<p><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/ProductiveRage/Blog/contents/Blog/App_Data/Posts?ref=master">api.github.com/repos/ProductiveRage/Blog/contents/Blog/App_Data/Posts?ref=master</a></p>
<p>.. and get results that look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[

<h3>Training a FastText model</h3>
<p>This raw blog post content needs to transformed into Catalyst &quot;documents&quot;, then tokenised (split into individual sentences and words), then fed into a FastText model trainer.</p>
<p>Before getting to the code, I want to discuss a couple of oddities coming up. Firstly, Catalyst documents are required to train the FastText model and each document instance must be uniquely identified by a <strong>UID128</strong> value, which is fine because we can generate them from the Title text of each blog post using the &quot;Hash128()&quot; extension method in Catalyst. However, (as we'll see a bit further down), when you ask for vectors* from the FastText model for the processed documents, each vector comes with a &quot;Token&quot; string that is the ID of the source document - so that has to be parsed <em>back</em> into a <strong>UID128</strong>. I'm not quite sure why the &quot;Token&quot; value isn't also a <strong>UID128</strong> but it's no massive deal.</p>
<p>* <em>(Vectors are just 1D arrays of floating point values - the FastText algorithm does magic to produce vectors that represent the text of the documents such that the distance between them can be compared; the length of these arrays is determined by the &quot;Dimensions&quot; option shown below and shorter distances between vectors suggest more similar content)</em></p>
<p>Next, there are the FastText settings that I've used. The <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst">Catalyst README</a> has some code near the bottom for training a FastText embedding model but I didn't have much luck with the default options. Firstly, when I used the &quot;FastText.ModelType.CBow&quot; option then I didn't get any vectors generated and so I tried changing it to &quot;FastText.ModelType.PVDM&quot; and things started looked promising. Then I fiddled with some of the other settings. Some of which I have a rough idea what they mean and some, erm.. not so much.</p>
<p>The settings that I ended up using are these:</p>
<pre><code>var fastText = new FastText(language, version: 0, tag: &quot;&quot;);
fastText.Data.Type = FastText.ModelType.PVDM;
fastText.Data.Loss = FastText.LossType.NegativeSampling;
fastText.Data.IgnoreCase = true;
fastText.Data.Epoch = 50;
fastText.Data.Dimensions = 512;
fastText.Data.MinimumCount = 1;
fastText.Data.ContextWindow = 10;
fastText.Data.NegativeSamplingCount = 20;
</code></pre>
<p>I already mentioned changing the Data.Type / ModelType and the LossType (&quot;NegativeSampling&quot;) is the value shown in the README. Then I felt like an obvious one to change was IgnoreCase, since that defaults to false and I think that I want it to be true - I don't care about the casing in any words when it's parsing my posts' content.</p>
<p>Now the others.. well, this library is built to work with systems with 10s or 100s of 1,000s of documents and that is a LOT more data than I have (currently around 120 blog posts) and so I made a few tweaks based on that. The &quot;Epoch&quot; count is the number of iterations that the training process will go through when constructing its model - by default, this is only 5 but I have limited data (meaning there's less for it to learn from but also that it's faster to complete each iteration) and so I bumped that up to 50. Then &quot;Dimensions&quot; is the size of the vectors generated - again, I figured that with limited data I would want a higher value and so I picked 512 (a nice round number if you're geeky enough) over the default 200. The &quot;MinimumCount&quot;, I believe, relates to how often a word may appear and it defaults to 5 so I pulled it down to 1. The &quot;ContextWindow&quot; is (again, I <em>think</em>) how far to either side of any word that the process will look at in order to determine context - the larger the value, the more expensive the calculation; I bumped this from the default 5 up to 10. Then there's the &quot;NegativeSamplingCount&quot; value.. I have to just put my hands up and say that I have no idea what that actually does, only that I seemed to be getting better results with a value of 20 than I was with the default of 10.</p>
<p>With machine learning, there is almost always going to be some value to tweaking options (the &quot;hyperparameters&quot;, if we're being all fancy) like this when building a model. Depending upon the model and the library, the defaults can be good for the general case but my tiny data set is not really what this library was intended for. Of course, machine learning <em>experts</em> have more idea <em>what</em> they're tweaking and (sometimes, at least) hopefully what results they'll get.. but I'm happy enough with where I've ended up with these.</p>
<p>This talk about what those machine learning experts do brings me on to the final thing that I wanted to talk about before showing the code; a little pre-processing / data-massaging. The better the data is that goes in, generally the better the results that come out will be. So another less glamorous part of the life of a Data Scientist is cleaning up data for training models.</p>
<p>In my case, that only extended to noticing that a few terms didn't seem to be getting recognised as essentially being the same thing and so I wanted to give it a little hand - for example, a fair number of my posts are about my &quot;Full Text Indexer&quot; project and so it probably makes sense to replace any instances of that string with a single concatenated word &quot;FullTextIndexer&quot;. And I have a range of posts about React but I didn't want it to get confused with the verb &quot;react&quot; and so I replaced any &quot;React&quot; occurrence with &quot;ReactJS&quot; (now, this probably means that some &quot;React&quot; verb occurrences were incorrectly changed but I made the replacements of this word in a case-sensitive manner and felt like I would have likely used it as the noun more often than a verb with a captial letter due to the nature of my posts).</p>
<p>So I have a method to tidy up the plain text content a little:</p>
<pre><code>private static string NormaliseSomeCommonTerms(string text) =&gt; text
    .Replace(&quot;.NET&quot;, &quot;NET&quot;, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
    .Replace(&quot;Full Text Indexer&quot;, &quot;FullTextIndexer&quot;, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
    .Replace(&quot;Bridge.net&quot;, &quot;BridgeNET&quot;, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
    .Replace(&quot;React&quot;, &quot;ReactJS&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's get training!</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Reading posts from GitHub repo..&quot;);
var posts = await GetBlogPosts();

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Parsing documents..&quot;);
Storage.Current = new OnlineRepositoryStorage(new DiskStorage(&quot;catalyst-models&quot;));
var language = Language.English;
var pipeline = Pipeline.For(language);
var postsWithDocuments = posts
    .Select(post =&gt;
    {
        var document = new Document(NormaliseSomeCommonTerms(post.PlainTextContent), language)
        {
            UID = post.Title.Hash128()
        };
        pipeline.ProcessSingle(document);
        return (Post: post, Document: document);
    })
    .ToArray(); // Call ToArray to force evaluation of the document processing now

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Training FastText model..&quot;);
var fastText = new FastText(language, version: 0, tag: &quot;&quot;);
fastText.Data.Type = FastText.ModelType.PVDM;
fastText.Data.Loss = FastText.LossType.NegativeSampling;
fastText.Data.IgnoreCase = true;
fastText.Data.Epoch = 50;
fastText.Data.Dimensions = 512;

    trainingStatus: update =&gt; Console.WriteLine($&quot; Progress: {update.Progress}, Epoch: {update.Epoch}&quot;)
);
</code></pre>
<h3>Identifying similar documents using the model</h3>
<p>Now that a model has been built that can represent all of my blog posts as vectors, we need to go through those post / vector combinations and identify others that are similar to it.</p>
<p>This will be achieved by using the <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/hnsw-sharp">HNSW.NET</a> NuGet package that enables K-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) searches over &quot;high-dimensional space&quot;*.</p>
<p>* <em>(This just means that the vectors are relatively large; 512 in this case - two dimensions would be a point on a flat plane, three dimensions would be a physical point in space, anything with more dimensions that that is in &quot;higher-dimensional space&quot;.. though that's not to say that any more than three dimensions is definitely a bad fit for a regular k-NN search but 512 dimensions IS going to be a bad fit and the HNSW approach will be much more efficient)</em></p>
<p>There are useful examples on the <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/hnsw-sharp#how-to-build-a-graph">README</a> about &quot;<strong>How to build a graph?</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>How to run k-NN search?</strong>&quot; and tweaking those for the data that I have so far leads to this:</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Building recommendations..&quot;);

// Combine the blog post data with the FastText-generated vectors
var results = fastText
    .GetDocumentVectors()
    .Select(result =&gt;
    {
        // Each document vector instance will include a &quot;token&quot; string that may be mapped back to the
        // UID of the document for each blog post. If there were a large number of posts to deal with
        // then a dictionary to match UIDs to blog posts would be sensible for performance but I only
        // have a 100+ and so a LINQ &quot;First&quot; scan over the list will suffice.
        var uid = UID128.Parse(result.Token);
        var postForResult = postsWithDocuments.First(
            postWithDocument =&gt; postWithDocument.Document.UID == uid
        );
        return (UID: uid, result.Vector, postForResult.Post);
    })
    .ToArray(); // ToArray since we enumerate multiple times below

// Construct a graph to search over, as described at
// https://github.com/curiosity-ai/hnsw-sharp#how-to-build-a-graph
var graph = new SmallWorld&lt;(UID128 UID, float[] Vector, BlogPost Post), float&gt;(
    distance: (to, from) =&gt; CosineDistance.NonOptimized(from.Vector, to.Vector),
    DefaultRandomGenerator.Instance,
    new() { M = 15, LevelLambda = 1 / Math.Log(15) }
);
graph.AddItems(results);

// For every post, use the &quot;KNNSearch&quot; method on the graph to find the three most similar posts
const int maximumNumberOfResultsToReturn = 3;
var postsWithSimilarResults = results
    .Select(result =&gt;
    {
        // Request one result too many from the KNNSearch call because it's expected that the original
        // post will come back as the best match and we'll want to exclude that
        var similarResults = graph
            .KNNSearch(result, maximumNumberOfResultsToReturn + 1)
            .Where(similarResult =&gt; similarResult.Item.UID != result.UID)
            .Take(maximumNumberOfResultsToReturn); // Just in case the original post wasn't included

        return new
        {
            result.Post,
            Similar = similarResults
                .Select(similarResult =&gt; new
                {
                    similarResult.Id,
                    similarResult.Item.Post,
                    similarResult.Distance
                })
                .ToArray()
        };
    })
    .OrderBy(result =&gt; result.Post.Title, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
    .ToArray();
</code></pre>
<p>And with that, there is a list of every post from my blog and a list of the three blog posts most similar to it!</p>
<p>Well, &quot;most similar&quot; according to the model that we trained and the hyperparameters that we used to do so. As with many machine learning algorithms, it will have started from a random state and tweaked and tweaked until it's time for it to stop (based upon the &quot;Epoch&quot; value in this FastText case) and so the results each time may be a little different.</p>
<p>However, if we inspect the results like this:</p>
<pre><code>foreach (var postWithSimilarResults in postsWithSimilarResults)
{
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine(postWithSimilarResults.Post.Title);
    foreach (var similarResult in postWithSimilarResults.Similar.OrderBy(other =&gt; other.Distance))
        Console.WriteLine($&quot;{similarResult.Distance:0.000} {similarResult.Post.Title}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. then there are some good results to be found! Like these:</p>
<blockquote>

<h3>Improving the results</h3>
<p>I'd like to get this good enough that I can include auto-generated recommendations on my blog and I don't feel like the consistency in quality is there yet. If they were all like the good examples then I'd be ploughing ahead right now with enabling it! But there are mediocre examples as well as those poorer ones above.</p>
<p>It's quite possible that I could get closer by experimenting with the hyperparameters more but that does tend to get tedious when you have to analyse the output of each run manually - looking through all the 120-ish post titles and deciding whether the supposed best matches are good or not. It would be lovely if I could concoct some sort of metric of &quot;goodness&quot; and then have the computer try lots of variations of parameters but one of the downsides of having relatively little data is that that is difficult*.</p>
<p>* <em>(On the flip side, if I had <strong>1,000s</strong> of blog posts as source data then the difficult part would be manually labelling enough of them as &quot;quite similar&quot; in numbers sufficient for the computer to know if it's done better or done worse with each experiment)</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, I have another trick up my sleeve - but I'm going to leave that for next time! This post is already more than long enough, I think. The plan is to combine results from <em>another</em> model in the Catalyst with the FastText results and see if I can encourage things to look a bit neater.</p>

        <h3 class="PostDate">9 March 2021</h3><h2><a id="language-detection-and-wordsinsentence-classification-in-c-sharp" href="/language-detection-and-wordsinsentence-classification-in-c-sharp">Language detection and words-in-sentence classification in C#</a></h2>
<h3>TL;(BG)DR</h3>
<p>Using an open source .NET library, it's easy to determine what language a sentence / paragraph / document is written in and to then classify the words in each sentence into verbs, nouns, etc..</p>
<h3>What library?</h3>
<p>I recently parted ways on very good terms with my last employers (and friends!) at <a href="https://curiosity.ai/">Curiosity AI</a> but that doesn't mean that I'm not still excited by their technology, some really useful aspects of which they have released as open source*.</p>
<p>* <em>(For the full service, ask yourself if your team or your company have ever struggled to find some information that you know exists somewhere but that might be in one of your network drives containing 10s of 1,000s of files <strong>or</strong> in your emails <strong>or</strong> in Sharepoint <strong>or</strong> GDrive somewhere - with Curiosity, you can set up a system that will index all that data so that it's searchable in one place, as well as learning synonyms and abbreviations in case you can't conjure up the precise terms to search for. It can even find similar documents for those case where have one document to hand and just know that there's another related to it but are struggling to find it - plus it has an ingrained permissions model so that your team could all index their emails and GDrive files and be secure in the knowledge that only they and people that they've shared the files with can see them; they don't get pulled in in such a way that your private, intimate, confidential emails are now visible to everyone!)</em></p>
<p>I have a little time off between jobs and so I wanted to write a little bit about some of the open-sourced projects that they released that I think are cool.</p>
<p>This first one is a really simple example but I think that it demonstrates how easily you can access capabilities that are pretty impressive.</p>
<p>This is my cat Cass:</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/Cass.jpg" alt="Cute little girl" /></p>
<p>She looks so cute that you'd think butter wouldn't melt. But, of my three cats, she is the prime suspect for the pigeon carcus that was recently dragged through the cat flap one night, up a flight of stairs and deposited outside my home office - and, perhaps not coincidentally, a mere six feet away from where she'd recently made herself a cosy bed in a duvet cover that I'd left out to remind myself to wash.</p>
<p>I think that it's a fair conclusion to draw that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My cat Cass is a lovely fluffy little pigeon-killer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you and I can easily see that that is a sentence written in English. But if you wanted a computer to work it out, how would you go about it?</p>
<p>Well, one way would be to install the <a href="https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst">Catalyst</a> <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Catalyst">NuGet package</a> and write the following code:</p>
<pre><code>using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Catalyst;
using Catalyst.Models;
using Mosaik.Core;
using Version = Mosaik.Core.Version;

namespace CatalystExamples
{
    internal static class Program
    {
        private static async Task Main()
        {
            const string text = &quot;My cat Cass is a lovely fluffy little pigeon-killer!&quot;;

            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Downloading/reading language detection models..&quot;);
            const string modelFolderName = &quot;catalyst-models&quot;;
            if (!new DirectoryInfo(modelFolderName).Exists)
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;- Downloading for the first time, so this may take a little while&quot;);
            
            Storage.Current = new OnlineRepositoryStorage(new DiskStorage(modelFolderName));
            var languageDetector = await FastTextLanguageDetector.FromStoreAsync(
                Language.Any,
                Version.Latest,
                &quot;&quot;
            );
            Console.WriteLine();

            var doc = new Document(text);
            languageDetector.Process(doc);

            Console.WriteLine(text);
            Console.WriteLine($&quot;Detected language: {doc.Language}&quot;);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this code will print the following to the console:</p>
<pre><code>Downloading/reading language detection models..
- Downloading for the first time, so this may take a little while

My cat Cass is a lovely fluffy little pigeon-killer!
Detected language: English
</code></pre>
<p>Just to prove that it doesn't <em>only</em> detect English, I ran the sentence through Google Translate to get a German version (unfortunately, the languages I'm fluent in are only English and a few computer languages and so Google Translate was very much needed!) - thus changing the &quot;text&quot; definition to:</p>
<pre><code>const string text = &quot;Meine Katze Cass ist eine schöne flauschige kleine Taubenmörderin!&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Running the altered program results in the following console output:</p>
<pre><code>Downloading/reading language detection models..

Meine Katze Cass ist eine wunderschöne, flauschige kleine Taubenmörderin!
Detected language: German
</code></pre>
<p>Great success!</p>
<p>The next thing that we can do is analyse the grammatical constructs of the sentence. I'm going to return to the English version for this because it will be easier for me to be confident that the word classifications are correct.</p>
<p>Add the following code immediately after the Console.WriteLine calls in the Main method from earlier:</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine($&quot;Downloading/reading part-of-speech model for {doc.Language}..&quot;);
var pipeline = await Pipeline.ForAsync(doc.Language);
pipeline.ProcessSingle(doc);
foreach (var sentence in doc)
{
    foreach (var token in sentence)
        Console.WriteLine($&quot;{token.Value}{new string(' ', 20 - token.Value.Length)}{token.POS}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The program will now write the following to the console:</p>
<p>Downloading/reading language detection models..</p>
<pre><code>My cat Cass is a lovely fluffy little pigeon-killer!
Detected language: English

Downloading/reading part-of-speech model for English..

<p>How easy was that?! There are a myriad of uses for this sort of analysis (one of the things that the full Curiosity system uses it for is identifying nouns throughout documents and creating tags that any documents sharing a given noun are linked via; so if you found one document about &quot;Flux Capacitors&quot; then you could easily identify all of the other documents / emails / memos that mentioned it - though that really is just the tip of the iceberg).</p>
<h3>Very minor caveats</h3>
<p>I have only a couple of warnings before signing off this post. I've seen the sentence detector get confused if it has very little data to work with (a tiny segment fragment, for example) or if there is a document that has different sections written in multiple languages - but I don't think that either case is unreasonable, the library is very clever but it can't perform magic!</p>
<h3>Coming soon</h3>
<p>I've got another post relating to their open-sourced libraries in the pipeline, hopefully I'll get that out this week! Let's just say that I'm hoping that my days of having to manually maintain the &quot;you may also be interested&quot; links between my posts will soon be behind me!</p>

        <h3 class="PostDate">4 April 2018</h3><h2><a id="writing-f-sharp-to-implement-the-single-layer-perceptron" href="/writing-f-sharp-to-implement-the-single-layer-perceptron">Writing F# to implement 'The Single Layer Perceptron'</a></h2>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>This picks up from my last post <a href="/learning-f-sharp-via-some-machine-learning-the-single-layer-percepton">Learning F# via some Machine Learning: The Single Layer Perceptron</a> where I described a simple neural network (&quot;The Single Layer Perceptron&quot;) and took a C# implementation (from an article on the site <a href="http://www.robosoup.com/2008/09/the-single-layer-perceptron-c.html">Robosoup</a>) and rewrote it into a style of &quot;functional C#&quot; with the intention of then translating it into F#. Trying to do that all in one post would have made for a very <em>very</em> long read and so part two, here, picks things up from that point.</p>
<p>I'm still an F# beginner and so I'm hoping that having the pain so fresh in my mind of trying to pick it up as a new language will make it easier for me to help others get started. I'm going to assume zero knowledge from the reader.</p>
<p><em>(I'm also going to try to dive straight right into things, rather than covering loads of theory first - I think that there are a lot of good resources out there that introduce you to F# and functional concepts at a more abstract level but I'm going to take the approach that we want to tackle something specific and we'll discuss new F# concepts only when we encounter them while trying to get this work done!)</em></p>
<h3>Translating the code into F#</h3>
<p>Visual Studio 2017 includes support for F# without having to install anything extra. To get started, create a new project of type Visual F# / Console Application. This will generate a Program.fs file that will let you build and run (it won't be anything very interesting if you run it but that doesn't matter because we're going rewrite the file from scratch!).</p>
<p>In the C# code from last time, the core logic was contained within a static method called &quot;Go&quot; within a static class. To set up the scaffolding for something similar in F# we'll use the following code:</p>
<pre><code>open System;

let private Go (r: Random) =
    &quot;TODO: Implement this&quot;

[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
let private Main _ =
    Go (new Random(0)) |&gt; ignore
    0
</code></pre>
<p>In F#, functions are declared by the keyword &quot;let&quot; optionally followed by an accessibility modifier (eg. &quot;private&quot;) followed by their name followed by their arguments followed by &quot;=&quot; followed by the function body.</p>
<p>The last line of the function body will be a value that is returned by the function (unlike C#, there is no need for an explicit &quot;return&quot; keyword).</p>
<p>Above, there is a function &quot;Go&quot; that takes a <strong>Random</strong> argument named &quot;r&quot; and that returns a string. The return type is not explicitly declared anywhere but F# relies upon type inference a lot of the time to make reduce the &quot;syntactic noise&quot; around declaring types where the compiler can work them out on its own. If you wanted reassurance that the type inference has worked as you expect then you can hover over the word &quot;Go&quot; and you'll see the following signature for the function -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>val private Go : r:Random -&gt; string</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This confirms that the function &quot;Go&quot; takes an argument named &quot;r&quot; of type <strong>random</strong> and that it returns a <strong>string</strong>.</p>
<p>If we changed the &quot;Go&quot; function to this:</p>
<pre><code>let private Go r =
    &quot;TODO: Implement this&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>.. and then hovered over the word &quot;Go&quot; then we'd see the following signature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>val private Go : r:'a -&gt; string</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially means that the type &quot;r&quot; is not fixed and that it may be any type because there is no way for the compiler to apply any restrictions to it based upon the code that it has access to. When comparing to C#, you might imagine that this would be equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code>private string Go(object r)
</code></pre>
<p>.. but it would actually be more accurate to think about it like a generic method - eg.</p>
<pre><code>private string Go&lt;T&gt;(T r)
</code></pre>
<p>The difference isn't important right now it's worth bearing in mind.</p>
<p>There's also a function &quot;Main&quot; that takes a single string argument argument named &quot;_&quot; and that returns an int. Just looking at this code, you may imagine that &quot;_&quot; would also be of an unknown / generic type but if you hover to the word &quot;Main&quot; then you'll see this signature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>val private main : string [] -&gt; int</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F# has applied some extra logic here, based upon the fact that the function has been annotated with <strong>[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]</strong> - this requires that the function matches the particular signature of string-array-to-string and you will get a compile error if you try to declare a function signature that differs from this.</p>
<p>The string array is a list of arguments passed to the compiled executable if called from the command line. This will never be of use in this program and so I've named that argument &quot;_&quot; to tell F# that I will never want to access it. I do this because F# will warn you if you have any unused arguments because it suggests that you have forgotten something (why specify an argument if you don't need it??). If you really don't care about one, though (as is the case here), if you give it an underscore prefix (or call it simply &quot;_&quot;) then the compiler won't warn you about it.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, F# will warn you if you call a function and ignore its return value. If the idea is that all functions be pure (and so have no side effects) then a function is useless if you ignore its return value. In the scaffolding above, though, we just want to call &quot;Go&quot; (which will do some calculations and write a summary to the console) - we don't really care about its return value. To tell the compiler this, we use a special function called &quot;ignore&quot; that we pass the return value of the &quot;Go&quot; function to. The C# way to do this might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ignore(Go(new Random(0)))
</code></pre>
<p>This is valid F# but it's criticised as having to be read &quot;inside out&quot;. It's more common in F# to see it like this:</p>
<pre><code>Go (new Random(0)) |&gt; ignore
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;pipe forward&quot; operator (|&gt;) effectively means take the value on the left and use it as the last argument in the function on the right. Since &quot;ignore&quot; only takes one argument, the two versions above are equivalent.</p>
<p>If a function has more than one argument then the pipe operator only provides the last one. To illustrate this, consider the method &quot;List.map&quot; that takes two arguments; a &quot;mapping&quot; delegate and a list of items. It's very similar to LINQ's &quot;Select&quot; method. You could call it like this:</p>
<pre><code>let numbers = [1;2;3]
let squares = List.map (fun x -&gt; x * x) numbers
</code></pre>
<p>I'll breeze through some of the syntax above in a moment but the important point here is that there is a method that takes two arguments where the second is a list.</p>
<p>It could be argued that this syntax is back-to-front because you may describe this in English as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>given a list of values, perform an operation on each item (and return a new list containing the transformed - or &quot;mapped&quot; - values)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. but the code puts things in the opposite order (&quot;list of values&quot; is mentioned last instead of first).</p>
<p>However, the pipe operator changes that -</p>
<pre><code>let numbers = [1;2;3]
let squares = numbers |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; x * x)
</code></pre>
<p>The code now is able to say &quot;here is the list, perform this operation on each value to provide me with a new list&quot;.</p>
<p>Because the pipe operator passes the value on the left as the <em>last</em> argument to the function on the right, F# often has list-based functions where the list is the last argument. This is often the opposite order to C# functions, where the &quot;subject&quot; of the operation is the commonly first argument.</p>
<p>Now, as promised, a quick rundown of F# syntax introduced above. The &quot;let&quot; keyword is very similar to C#'s &quot;var&quot; in that it use type inference to determine what type the specific reference should be. <em>Unlike</em> &quot;var&quot;, though, you can't change the reference later on - eg.</p>
<pre><code>let numbers = [1;2;3]

// Invalid! This &quot;=&quot; operator is treated as a comparison whose return value is ignored
// rather than this statement being a reassignment - the &quot;numbers&quot; reference is still
// a list with the values 1, 2 and 3 (a compiler warning will be displayed)
numbers = [1;2;3;4]
</code></pre>
<p>Because F# <em>only</em> allows you to set value in statements that include the &quot;let&quot; operator, it makes it easier for the F# compiler to know whether the code fragment:</p>
<pre><code>a = b
</code></pre>
<p>is an assignment or a comparison - if it follows a &quot;let&quot; then it's always an assignment but otherwise it's a comparison.</p>
<p>This is unlike C# where the following is acceptable:</p>
<pre><code>var numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };

// This is allowed in C#
numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
</code></pre>
<p>.. and this means that the C# compiler can't as easily tell whether the code fragment &quot;a = b&quot; is an assignment or a comparison and <em>that</em> is why C# has the assignment operator &quot;=&quot; and a separate equality comparison operator &quot;==&quot; (and why F# can use &quot;=&quot; as both the assignment operator <em>and</em> equality comparison operator).</p>
<p>The next thing to talk about is that F# allows you to declare a list of values using square brackets and semi-colons as the separators. So the below are <em>similar</em> (but not equivalent, as I'll explain) in C#<br />
and F# -</p>
<pre><code>var numbers = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3 }; // C#

let numbers = [1;2;3] // F#
</code></pre>
<p>The reason that they're similar and not identical is that the C# code uses the <strong>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt;</strong> type, which is mutable (you can add, remove and replace items within a list). In F#, the list is <em>immutable</em> and so any operation (such as add, remove or replace) would return a new list reference, rather than mutating the existing list.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that semi-colons are not present at the end of each F# line in the examples above. That's because they are not required. F# uses whitespace (such as line returns and indenting) to determine when statements terminate and when they continue and so semi-colons are not used to specify where statements finish (unlike in C#, where they are).</p>
<p>Finally, there was a delegate shown in the above code -</p>
<pre><code>(fun x -&gt; x * x)
</code></pre>
<p>This is an anonymous function. The F# code:</p>
<pre><code>let numbers = [1;2;3]
let squares = numbers |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; x * x)
</code></pre>
<p>is roughly the same as the following C# code:</p>
<pre><code>var numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };
var squares = numbers.Select(x =&gt; x * x);
</code></pre>
<p>It's not <em>precisely</em> the same since &quot;numbers&quot; in the F# code is an immutable list reference and in C# it's an array but it's close enough. The point is that the &quot;fun&quot; keyword is used to declare an anonymous function and that brackets are required around that function declaration in order to segregate that code and make it clear to the compiler that the function declaration should be considered as a single value that is being passed to the &quot;List.map&quot; function.</p>
<h3>Declaring training data</h3>
<p>In the C# perceptron code from <a href="/learning-f-sharp-via-some-machine-learning-the-single-layer-percepton">last week</a>, there was an array of <strong>Tuple</strong> values that contained each pair of inputs and the expected result -</p>
<pre><code>var trainingData = new[]
{
  Pattern(0.08, 0.94, true),

  // .. more patterns
};
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;Pattern&quot; function was just this:</p>
<pre><code>private static Tuple&lt;double[], bool&gt; Pattern(double x, double y, bool output)
{
  return Tuple.Create(new[] { x, y }, output);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>Tuple</strong> class is a very convenient way to represent small groups of values (such as an input array and the expected boolean output) but one thing that I don't like is that the properties are named &quot;Item1&quot;, &quot;Item2&quot;, etc.. rather than it being possible to give them more descriptive labels.</p>
<p>I could have defined a class to contain these values but that can involve a lot of boilerplate code (particularly if it's an immutable class, which would be my preference when creating classes that describe data that should be initialised once and never changed).</p>
<p>Fortunately, F# has a convenient way to describe data like this called &quot;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/records">Records</a>&quot; - immutable types that may be defined using very little syntax, such as by pasting the following into the F# scaffolding from earlier, just after &quot;Open System&quot; -</p>
<pre><code>type private Input = { Values: float list; Result: bool }
</code></pre>
<p>It is now possible to define an input list / output boolean object with properties name &quot;Values&quot; and &quot;Result&quot; like this:</p>
<pre><code>let x = { Values = [0.08; 0.94]; Result = true }
</code></pre>
<p>The type of &quot;x&quot; is not explicitly specified in the code but the compiler will be able to match it to the <strong>Input</strong> type.</p>
<h3>double vs float</h3>
<p>Note that I've defined the &quot;Values&quot; property to be of type &quot;float list&quot; (which is equivalent to &quot;list&lt;float&gt;&quot; - which is also valid syntax in F#) as opposed to &quot;double list&quot;. In C#, <strong>Double</strong> and <strong>double</strong> represent a &quot;double-precision floating point number&quot; while <strong>Single</strong> and <strong>float</strong> represent a &quot;single-precision floating point number&quot;. In F#, <strong>float</strong> is a double-precision floating point number while <strong>float32</strong> is a <em>single</em>-precision floating point number. So &quot;float&quot; in F# is the same as &quot;double&quot; in C#. To make things more confusing, you can also specify the type <strong>double</strong> in F# and it means the same as <strong>float</strong> in F# - however, type signatures in the F# library specify <strong>float</strong> when a double-precision floating point number is returned and so I'm specifying <strong>float</strong> to try to be consistent with other F# code. For example, the library function &quot;Double.Parse&quot; returns <strong>float</strong> according to intellisense.</p>
<p>This seems quite confusing to me (coming at this from C#) but I decided to try to be as F#-like as possible and so &quot;float list&quot; is what I'm using.</p>
<h3>Back to declaring training data..</h3>
<p>To declare all of the training data in F#, we want a list of patterns -</p>
<pre><code>let trainingData = [
    { Values = [0.08; 0.94]; Result = true }
    { Values = [0.13; 0.95]; Result = true }

    // .. more patterns
  ]
</code></pre>
<p>When declaring a list (items within square brackets), they may either be separated by semi-colons or by line returns. So, above, each pattern is on its own line and so no semi-colons need to separate them while the individual numbers within the &quot;Values&quot; lists <em>do</em> need semi-colon separators since there are no line returns to break them up.</p>
<p>In the C# code, the &quot;Pattern&quot; function specifically took two &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; arguments and so each <strong>Tuple</strong> had an &quot;Item1&quot; property which was an array with two elements. In the above code, there would be no compiler warning if I accidentally included a line where the pattern had more &quot;Values&quot; entries than the others. As a sanity check, we can include the following code after the &quot;trainingData&quot; list is declared -</p>
<pre><code>let inputLengths =
    trainingData
    |&gt; List.map (fun input -&gt; input.Values.Length)
    |&gt; List.distinct
    |&gt; List.length
if (inputLengths &gt; 1) then raise (Exception &quot;Inconsistent pattern input lengths!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>There's a lot of piping here, which seems to be quite common in F# code. Hopefully, though, it illustrates how using the pipe operator allows code to be written in a more logical order. Here, we're saying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the trainingData list</li>
<li>Construct a list where each entry in the new list corresponds to the number of inputs in a trainingData entry</li>
<li>Build a new list from <em>this</em> by taking this list-of-input-lengths and excluding any duplicates</li>
<li>If the list from step 3 has more than one entry then the trainingData must not have entries that all have the same number of inputs</li>
</ol>
<p>If the &quot;trainingData&quot; has patterns which all have the same number of inputs then there should only be one unique input input-list-length. If some patterns had two inputs and some patterns had three inputs then we would get more than one <em>unique</em> input-list-length and that would not be good.</p>
<p>Since F# has a concept of &quot;significant whitespace&quot; (meaning that it uses line returns and indentation to indicate where expressions start and end, which is why semi-colons are not required to terminate lines), sometimes it can get a bit demanding about what it thinks it ok and what isn't. In the code above, if you tried to put the &quot;trainingData&quot; on the same line as the &quot;let inputLengths =&quot; and then have the pipe operator lines start underneath it then you will get cryptic errors such as &quot;The block following this 'let' is unfinished&quot;. Using the format above not only means that your code will be more consistent with other F# &quot;in the wild&quot; but it also means that the compiler will understand it!</p>
<pre><code>// The F# compiler is happy with this..
let inputLengths =
    trainingData
    |&gt; List.map (fun input -&gt; input.Values.Length)
    |&gt; List.distinct
    |&gt; List.length

// .. it is NOT happy with this..
let inputLengths = trainingData
    |&gt; List.map (fun input -&gt; input.Values.Length)
    |&gt; List.distinct
    |&gt; List.length
</code></pre>
<p>(I would not have thought that putting &quot;trainingData&quot; on the same line as &quot;let inputLengths =&quot; would introduce any ambiguity but presumably doing similar things must do in some situations).</p>
<h3>Translating the network-training code</h3>
<p>The c# code that we ended up with <a href="/learning-f-sharp-via-some-machine-learning-the-single-layer-percepton">last time</a> for training a network looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>const double learningRate = 0.1;

var finalResult = Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue)
  .Scan(
    seed: new
    {
      Weights = new[] { r.NextDouble(), r.NextDouble() },
      Bias = 0d,
      GlobalError = double.MaxValue
    },
    func: (previousState, iteration) =&gt;
    {
      var resultForIteration = trainingData.Aggregate(
        seed: new { Weights = previousState.Weights, Bias = previousState.Bias, GlobalError = 0d },
        func: (stateSoFar, pattern) =&gt;
        {
          var output = Output(stateSoFar.Weights, stateSoFar.Bias, pattern.Item1) ? 1 : -1;
          var localError = (pattern.Item2 ? 1 : -1) - output;
          return new
          {
            Weights = UpdateWeights(stateSoFar.Weights, learningRate, localError, pattern.Item1),
            Bias = stateSoFar.Bias + (learningRate * localError),
            GlobalError = stateSoFar.GlobalError + Math.Abs(localError)
          };
        }
      );
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, resultForIteration.GlobalError);
      return resultForIteration;
    }
  )
  .First(state =&gt; state.GlobalError &lt;= 0);
</code></pre>
<p>.. and relied upon the following two functions:</p>
<pre><code>private static bool Output(double[] weights, double bias, double[] inputs)
{
  var sum = inputs.Zip(weights, (input, weight) =&gt; input * weight).Sum() + bias;
  return (sum &gt;= 0);
}

private static double[] UpdateWeights(double[] weights, double learningRate, double localError, double[] inputs)
{
  if (localError == 0)
    return weights;

  return weights
    .Zip(inputs, (weight, input) =&gt; weight + (learningRate * localError * input))
    .ToArray();
}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm going to start with translating the &quot;Output&quot; function first because it will be relatively straight forward but it will also demonstrate some interesting abilities of the F# compiler's type inference abilities.</p>
<p>Type inference means that there are a <em>lot</em> of types that you don't have to specify in F# code because the compiler will be able to work out what they are. But this can be confusing sometimes if you don't have a strong enough grasp on <em>how</em> the compiler does this.</p>
<p>Because I'm still an F# noob, I like to specify function arguments types to begin with and then remove them afterwards once I can see that the compiler is happy without them <em>and when I understand how the compiler knows</em>. So I'll start with this:</p>
<pre><code>let Output (weights: float list) (bias: float) (inputs: float list) =
    let sum = (List.zip weights inputs |&gt; List.map (fun (weight, input) -&gt; weight * input) |&gt; List.sum) + bias
    sum &gt;= float 0
</code></pre>
<p>The brackets around the arguments are required to &quot;group&quot; the argument name and its type into one value. When we remove the type annotations shortly, the argument brackets will no longer be necessary.</p>
<p>The &quot;List.zip&quot; function is very similar to LINQ's &quot;Zip&quot; function except that it has no facility to take a delegate to combine the two values, instead it always returns a tuple for each pair of values that it combines.</p>
<p><em>(I didn't use the pipe operator with the &quot;List.zip&quot; call above because I think that it read more naturally without it in this case - I think of this as &quot;zipping the weights and inputs lists together&quot; and that is what the code says)</em></p>
<p>F# has nice support for tuples that allows us to avoid having to rely upon &quot;Item1&quot; and &quot;Item2&quot; accesses. The lambda above that performs multiplication would have to look something like this in C# if the input was a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>weightAndInput =&gt; weightAndInput.Item1 * weightAndInput.Item2
</code></pre>
<p>.. but F# allows us to &quot;deconstruct&quot; the tuple by providing names for the tuple properties - ie.</p>
<pre><code>fun (weight, input) -&gt; weight * input
</code></pre>
<p>This is still a function that takes a single argument, it's just that that single argument is a two-item tuple and we're accessing its two items through named references &quot;weight&quot; and &quot;input&quot;.</p>
<p>Hopefully the rest of the code is easy to understand, &quot;List.zip&quot; is like LINQ's &quot;Zip&quot; and &quot;List.map&quot; is like LINQ's &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;List.sum&quot; is like LINQ's &quot;Sum&quot;.</p>
<p>The second line &quot;sum &gt;= float 0&quot; is the return value for the function - either true or false. The expression &quot;float 0&quot; is important because the &quot;sum&quot; value will be a <strong>float</strong> and F# will not attempt <em>any</em> type coercion when comparing values. In C#, if you have two numeric types then you can compare them - eg.</p>
<pre><code>// Valid in C#
double x1 = 0; // double
int x2 = 0;    // int
var isMatch = (x1 == x2);
</code></pre>
<p>.. but in F# this is not allowed. If you tried to write the following:</p>
<pre><code>// Not allowed in F#
let x1 = float 0 // float
let x2 = 0       // int
let isMatch = (x1 = x2)
</code></pre>
<p>.. then you would get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This expression was expected to have type 'float' but here has type 'int'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we're happy with the function implementation, we can remove the type annotations and reduce it to this:</p>
<pre><code>let Output weights bias inputs =
    let sum = (List.zip weights inputs |&gt; List.map (fun (weight, input) -&gt; weight * input) |&gt; List.sum) + bias
    sum &gt;= float 0
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler is able to infer all of those types. Some of the inference is quite simple - for example, both &quot;weights&quot; and &quot;inputs&quot; must be lists of some type because they are passed to &quot;List.zip&quot;.</p>
<p>Some of the inference is more complicated, though..</p>
<p>Firstly, the &quot;weights&quot; and &quot;inputs&quot; list must have element types that support a &quot;*&quot; operator (in F#, this means any of the numeric types or any type that has got a custom &quot;*&quot; overload implemented on it).</p>
<p>Secondly, when elements are combined from &quot;weight&quot; and &quot;inputs&quot; using &quot;*&quot;, it must be possible to use the &quot;+&quot; operator on the result because &quot;List.sum&quot; requires it (the internal implementation of &quot;List.sum&quot; is to combine all of the values passed to it using &quot;+&quot;).</p>
<p>Thirdly, the result from &quot;List.sum&quot; must also support the &quot;+&quot; operator in conjunction with whatever type that &quot;bias&quot; is.</p>
<p>Fourthly, <em>this</em> result must support the &quot;&gt;=&quot; operator in conjunction with &quot;float 0&quot;.</p>
<p>Working backwards, because F# does not support any type coercion when comparing numeric values, the type of &quot;sum&quot; must be <strong>float</strong> in order for it to be compared to &quot;float 0&quot;. This means that the result of &quot;List.sum&quot; must be <strong>float</strong> and so &quot;bias&quot; must be <strong>float</strong>. This means that the &quot;weights&quot; and &quot;inputs&quot; must be lists of <strong>float</strong>. (The return type of the function is <strong>boolean</strong> because the return value is always true or false as it is the result of an &quot;&gt;=&quot; comparison).</p>
<p>This type inference is very powerful and can lead to clean and succint code. However, it can also lead to confusion if you haven't perfectly internalised its workings or if you're dealing with incomplete code. It's for both of those reasons that I prefer to start with more argument type annotations than necessary and then remove them later, when I'm happy with what I've written.</p>
<p>The &quot;UpdateWeights&quot; function may be translated in a similar manner -</p>
<pre><code>let UpdateWeights weights localError inputs =
    if (localError = float 0)
        then weights
        else
            List.zip weights inputs
            |&gt; List.map (fun (weight, input) -&gt; weight + (learningRate * localError * input))
</code></pre>
<p>In F#, if / then / else is a bit different to C#. In F#, it is an expression that returns a value, so you could write something like:</p>
<pre><code>// Valid F#
let x = if something then 1 else 2

// Not valid C#
var x = if something then 1 else 2
</code></pre>
<p>So, in the F# &quot;UpdateWeights&quot; function, the &quot;if&quot; expression returns either the original &quot;weights&quot; reference or the updated list.</p>
<p>We've actually seen quite a lot of F# syntax, just in the code above - variable and function definitions, type annotations (and discussed how they are optional in many cases), anonymous functions (with the &quot;fun&quot; keyword), the pipe forward operator, record types, tuple deconstruction. Let's throw in another one; nested functions. The two functions shown above (&quot;Output&quot; and &quot;UpdateWeights&quot;) will only be called from within the &quot;Go&quot; function that was part of the initial scaffolding code. We <em>could</em> make these private functions at the same level as &quot;Go&quot;.. <em>or</em> we can make them <em>nested</em> functions <em>within</em> &quot;Go&quot; so that their scope is as restrictive as possible (which is a good thing in my book) -</p>
<pre><code>let private Go (r: Random) =

    let Output weights bias inputs =
        let sum = (List.zip weights inputs |&gt; List.map (fun (weight, input) -&gt; weight * input) |&gt; List.sum) + bias
        sum &gt;= float 0

    let UpdateWeights weights localError inputs =
        if (localError = float 0)
            then weights
            else
                List.zip weights inputs
                |&gt; List.map (fun (weight, input) -&gt; weight + (learningRate * localError * input))

    &quot;TODO: Implement this&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Sidebar: The influence of F# on C#</h3>
<p>It seems that quite a lot of features from F# are coming over to C# from C# 7 onwards. For example, nested functions are already available (they weren't in C# 6 but they <em>are</em> in C# 7) - eg.</p>
<pre><code>public static void Go()
{
  int GetNumber()
  {
    return 123;
  }

  Console.WriteLine(GetNumber());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, Tuple deconstruction is also now available -</p>
<pre><code>public static void Go()
{
  var (inputs, output) = GetPattern();
  Console.WriteLine(string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, inputs));
  Console.WriteLine(output);
}

// Note: We're not returning a &quot;Tuple&lt;double[], bool&gt;&quot; here, it's a different type (and it requires
// the &quot;System.ValueType&quot; package to be added to the project
private static (double[] inputs, bool output) GetPattern()
{
  return (new[] { 0.5, 0.6 }, true);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Coming at some point (looks like it will be C# 8), there will be support for defining record types -</p>
<pre><code>// This syntax is not yet available (as of January 2018)
public class Point(int X, int Y);
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>Point</strong> class will have X and Y properties that are set through a constructor call. It will have an &quot;Equals&quot; implementation that will return true for two <strong>Point</strong> references that have the same X and Y values (and probably have == and != operator overloads that do the same thing) <em>and</em> it will have a &quot;With&quot; method that allows you to take an instance of a <strong>Point</strong> and create a new instance that has a new value for either X or Y - eg.</p>
<pre><code>var p1 = new Point(1, 2);
var p2 = new Point(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2); // True!

p2 = p2.With(X: 7);
Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2); // False
</code></pre>
<p>(For more details about C# record types, see the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/records.md">records proposal</a>).</p>
<p>It's interesting to see these features working their way into C# and hopefully it will make it easier for someone in the future to try F# if they already know C#. (Some may argue that it could make F# less appealing with more of its features being added to C# but I think that it will still have enough differences to stand apart - having immutability and non-nulls <em>by default</em> is not something that is likely to be incorporated into C# because it would require enormous changes).</p>
<h3>Back to translating the network-training code..</h3>
<p>Now that the supporting functions (&quot;Output&quot; and &quot;UpdateWeights&quot;) have been translated, we need to look back at the main training code. This time I'm going to go &quot;outside in&quot; and translate this:</p>
<pre><code>const double learningRate = 0.1;

var finalResult = Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue)
  .Scan(
    seed: new
    {
      Weights = new[] { r.NextDouble(), r.NextDouble() },
      Bias = 0d,
      GlobalError = double.MaxValue
    },
    func: (previousState, iteration) =&gt;
    {
      // Do work here..
    }
  )
  .First(state =&gt; state.GlobalError &lt;= 0);
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue)&quot; line was basically a way to say &quot;keep enumerating for ever&quot; (int.MaxValue isn't technically the same as &quot;forever&quot; but in this context it's good enough because we'll die of boredom waiting for the code to perform two billion iterations).</p>
<p>In F# there is a function that seems closer to what we want called &quot;Seq.initInfinite&quot; - this takes a single argument that is a delegate that takes an int and returns a value in the generated sequence based upon that int. It could be implemented in C# like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; InitInfinite&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;int, T&gt; initialiser)
{
  return Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue).Select(initialiser);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>also</em> limited to int.MaxValue iterations since the delegate argument is an <strong>int</strong> but we're <em>still</em> not going to worry too much about whether it's <em>really</em> infinite or not.</p>
<p>From my last post, we know that &quot;Scan&quot; is already an F# concept and so that should be easy to translate.</p>
<p>The last function to translate is &quot;First&quot; and this has a corresponding function in F#; &quot;Seq.find&quot;.</p>
<p>The only issue that we have to tackle now is that F# does not support anonymous types and so we'll need to declare another record type that I'll call &quot;CalculationState&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>type private CalculationState = {
    Weights: List&lt;float&gt;
    Bias: float
    GlobalError: float
}
</code></pre>
<p>When I defined the &quot;Input&quot; record earlier, I used a single line definition and so each property had to be separated by semi-colons. Above, each property is on its line and so semi-colon delimiters are not required.</p>
<p>Now we can translate the above C# into this F#:</p>
<pre><code>let finalResult =
    Seq.initInfinite (fun i -&gt; i)
    |&gt; Seq.scan
        (fun previousState iteration -&gt;
            // Do work here..
        )
        { Weights = [r.NextDouble(); r.NextDouble()]; Bias = float 0; GlobalError = Double.MaxValue }
    |&gt; Seq.find (fun state -&gt; state.GlobalError = float 0)
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;// Do work here..&quot; code looks like this in C# -</p>
<pre><code>var resultForIteration = trainingData.Aggregate(
  seed: new { Weights = previousState.Weights, Bias = previousState.Bias, GlobalError = 0d },
  func: (stateSoFar, pattern) =&gt;
  {
    var output = Output(stateSoFar.Weights, stateSoFar.Bias, pattern.Item1) ? 1 : -1;
    var localError = (pattern.Item2 ? 1 : -1) - output;
    return new
    {
      Weights = UpdateWeights(stateSoFar.Weights, learningRate, localError, pattern.Item1),
      Bias = stateSoFar.Bias + (learningRate * localError),
      GlobalError = stateSoFar.GlobalError + Math.Abs(localError)
    };
  }
);
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, resultForIteration.GlobalError);
return resultForIteration;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm going to break this out into a separate function in the F# code because I want to avoid the final code being too &quot;dense&quot; (particularly while I'm still getting used to reading F# syntax and common structures / flow) so I'll change the F# outer code to this:</p>
<pre><code>let finalResult =
    Seq.initInfinite (fun i -&gt; i)
    |&gt; Seq.scan
        CalculateNextState
        { Weights = [r.NextDouble(); r.NextDouble()]; Bias = float 0; GlobalError = Double.MaxValue }
    |&gt; Seq.find (fun state -&gt; state.GlobalError = float 0)
</code></pre>
<p>.. and then define this nested function:</p>
<pre><code>let CalculateNextState (state: CalculationState) (iteration: int) =
    // Do work here..
</code></pre>
<p>(Again, I've started by including explicit type annotations for the arguments but I'll be able to remove them later).</p>
<p>The C# code used the &quot;Aggregate&quot; function which corresponds to &quot;List.fold&quot; in F# and &quot;Console.WriteLine&quot; which corresponds to &quot;printfn&quot;. With everything that we've covered already, it shouldn't be a big leap to see that the complete implementation of the &quot;CalculateNextState&quot; function will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>let CalculateNextState (state: CalculationState) (iteration: int) =
    let resultForIteration =
        List.fold
            (fun stateSoFar input -&gt;
                let output = if (Output stateSoFar.Weights stateSoFar.Bias input.Values) then 1 else -1
                let localError = float ((if input.Result then 1 else -1) - output)
                {
                    Weights =
                        if (localError = float 0)
                        then stateSoFar.Weights
                        else UpdateWeights stateSoFar.Weights localError input.Values
                    Bias =
                        if (localError = float 0)
                        then stateSoFar.Bias
                        else stateSoFar.Bias + (learningRate * localError)
                    GlobalError = stateSoFar.GlobalError + Math.Abs(localError)
                }
            )
            { Weights = state.Weights; Bias = state.Bias; GlobalError = float 0 }
            trainingData
    printfn &quot;Iteration %i\tError %i&quot; iteration (int resultForIteration.GlobalError)
    resultForIteration
</code></pre>
<p>It's still taking me a little while to get used to there being no &quot;return&quot; keyword and so I sometimes have to remind myself that the anonymous function passed to &quot;List.fold&quot; returns the { Weights, Bias, GlobalError } value and that the &quot;CalculateNextState&quot; function returns the &quot;resultForIteration&quot; that is on its last line.</p>
<p>Now that the function is fully defined, the type annotations can be removed from the &quot;state&quot; and &quot;iteration&quot; arguments. The &quot;state&quot; type is inferred because &quot;List.fold&quot; takes an initial value that has the properties Weights (float list) / Bias (float) / GlobalError (float) and the anonymous function also returns a value of that type and the only record type that matches those properties is &quot;CalculationState&quot;. The &quot;iteration&quot; argument is inferred because it is used as an argument in the &quot;printfn&quot; call to populate a &quot;%i&quot; placeholder and &quot;%i&quot; placeholder values have to be integers.</p>
<h3>Writing to console using printfn and &quot;string interpolation&quot;</h3>
<p>You might have noticed that in the code above, the C# write-info-to-console line:</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, resultForIteration.GlobalError);
</code></pre>
<p>was translated into this in F#:</p>
<pre><code>printfn &quot;Iteration %i\tError %i&quot; iteration (int resultForIteration.GlobalError)
</code></pre>
<p>In principle, it's very similar; there are placeholders in the format string (which is what the &quot;%i&quot; values are in the F# code above) that will be populated with arguments passed to Console.WriteLine / printfn but there are a couple of key differences. The first is that the &quot;%i% placeholder requires that the value used to populate it is an integer (alternatives are &quot;%s&quot; for strings, &quot;%f&quot; for floats and &quot;%b&quot; for booleans) but the second is much more exciting - the format string and the provided arguments are verified <em>at compile time</em> in the F# code whereas the C# code is only verified at <em>run time</em>. To make it really crystal clear what I mean by this, the following C# code will compile but fail when it's run -</p>
<pre><code>// This will fail at runtime with &quot;System.FormatException: 'Index (zero based) must be greater
// than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list.'&quot; because there are two
// placeholders in the format string but only one value provided
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello {0}, {1}&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, the following F# won't even <em>compile</em> -</p>
<pre><code>// Will refuse to compile: &quot;This expression is a function value, i.e. is missing arguments.&quot;
printfn &quot;Hello %s, %s&quot; &quot;test&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This makes me happy because I'm all about making the compiler catch simple mistakes instead of allowing them to surface at runtime.</p>
<p>Now, I will admit that I was using a somewhat old school method of writing messages there in C#. C#6 introduced its own interpretation of &quot;string interpolation&quot; that allows us to combine the &quot;template string&quot; with the placeholder values so that we don't accidentally include too many or too few placeholder value arguments. Instead of writing this:</p>
<pre><code>// Old style
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, resultForIteration.GlobalError);
</code></pre>
<p>.. we could write this:</p>
<pre><code>// C# 6 string interpolation
Console.WriteLine($&quot;Iteration {iteration}\tError {resultForIteration.GlobalError});
</code></pre>
<p>I would argue that this is even better again than the F# approach and it's unfortunate that F# doesn't currently have anything quite like this. That is one of the downsides to F# pioneering and pushing a lot of useful techniques that were later incorporated in to C#, I suppose!</p>
<p><em>(There is a proposal to add something similar to F# but it doesn't exist yet and I don't think that there is any suggestions that it will become available any time soon - see <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/RFCs/FS-1001-StringInterpolation.md">F# RFC FS-1001 - String Interpolation</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Sidebar: Selecting F# BCL functions</h3>
<p>A little earlier, I nonchalantly said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The C# code used the &quot;Aggregate&quot; function which corresponds to &quot;List.fold&quot; in F#</p>

<p>.. and you may (quite reasonably) have wondered how you or I were supposed to know that &quot;Aggregate&quot; in C# is equivalent to &quot;fold&quot; in F#.</p>
<p>You may also have picked up on the fact that sometimes I'm using &quot;Seq&quot; functions (such as &quot;Seq.initInfinite&quot;) and sometimes I'm using &quot;List&quot; functions (such as &quot;List.fold&quot;) and be wondering how I'm deciding which to use.</p>
<p>I'll address the second point first. As I do so, it's worth bearing in mind that I'm going to explain how <em>I</em> have been deciding up to this point and <em>hopefully</em> it's a sensible approach but there's always a chance that someone who knows better (maybe me in six months!) will have a slightly different take on things..</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I'm going to use &quot;List&quot; if I'm certain that I want to fully evaluate the set of items. In the &quot;CalculateNextState&quot; function, I want to take all of the weights in the current state and generate a completely updated set of weights to use in the next iteration - in that next iteration, I will be using <em>all</em> of the just-calculated weights to generate <em>another</em> completely updated set of weights. Every time, I will be considering <em>every</em> weight value and there would be no benefit to lazily evaluating the data and I think that lazy evaluation is one of the main benefits to using &quot;Seq&quot;. When I don't know how many iterations will be required, I start by lazily evaluating an infinite set of items by calling &quot;Seq.initInfinite&quot; and then terminating enumeration when I get a state with a sufficiently low GlobalError. This approach <em>only</em> works because the sequence is evaluated &quot;lazily&quot; - it would make no sense for there to be a &quot;List.initInfinite&quot; because that list's contents would have to be fully populated at runtime and you'd run out of memory!</p>
<p>I suspect that a case <em>could</em> be made for always using &quot;Seq&quot; unless you find a compelling reason not to.. where a compelling case is that you need pattern matching* or if you're sure that using &quot;Seq&quot; is resulting in expensive operations being repeated because you are enumerating over a sequence multiple times and the operations in each enumeration are complex / expensive (if you used &quot;List&quot; then you would be sure that the work to build the list would only be done once, no matter how many times you enumerated over it).</p>
<p>* <em>(which we haven't encountered yet but which is fairly common in F# code and which only works with instances of <strong>list</strong> and not of <strong>seq</strong>)</em></p>
<p>F# also supports arrays but these tend to used in fairly niche situations - such as when interoperating with other .NET code that requires an array or when you've found a performance bottleneck in your code relating to indexed access into your set of items (for both a <strong>seq</strong> and a <strong>list</strong> it's relatively slow to jump straight to the nth item because you have to start at the beginning and walk that many items into the list, whereas with an array you can jump straight there).. but arrays have their disadvantages, such as being mutable (bleurgh, filthy!) and having no cheap way to create a new version with a single new item (which also applies to <strong>seq</strong> but which is something that <strong>list</strong> can do well).</p>
<p>So (for now?) I'll be using a <strong>list</strong> if I have a known set of items and will be performing an operation on every item each iteration and a <strong>seq</strong> otherwise.. unless I encounter a really exciting reason to do otherwise*.</p>
<p>* <em>(Spoiler alert: in a future post in the series, I will find a case where there is a huge difference in memory usage between <strong>list</strong> and <strong>array</strong> when loading data from disk - brace yourself for that thrill!)</em></p>
<p>To return to my first point in relation to &quot;Selecting F# BCL functions&quot; - how did I know that &quot;List.fold&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Aggregate&quot;? The simple answer is by looking through the docs.. the MSDN pages are pretty good (here is the one for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/list.fold%5B%27t,%27state%5D-function-%5Bfsharp%5D">List.fold</a>) and the number of base library functions is not that large. You can often guess what many of them do (such as &quot;List.average&quot; and &quot;List.distinct&quot;) but you might need to read the documentation for others (either on MSDN or just via the intellisense tooltips) for others. If you are familiar with LINQ then it shouldn't take you too long to learn the names of the F# equivalents of many of your old favourites!</p>
<h3>Demonstrating the network's abilities</h3>
<p>Before I went on a couple of tangents about writing to the console and learning the F# BCL, we had actually finished translating the code that trained the network (it may be an <em>extremely</em> simple one but it <em>is</em> still technically a network!). Now the only C# that remains to be translated is the code that passes pairs of inputs through the network to see what output it generates for each pair - just to ensure that it matches our expectations. This is how we left it last time:</p>
<pre><code>const double startAt = 0;
const double endAt = 1;
const double increment = 0.25;
var range = Enumerable.Range(0, (int)((endAt - startAt) / increment) + 1).Select(value =&gt; value * increment);
var xyPairs = range.SelectMany(value =&gt; range, (x, y) =&gt; new[] { x, y });
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(
  Environment.NewLine,
  xyPairs.Select(inputs =&gt; $&quot;{string.Join(&quot;\t&quot;, inputs)}\t{(Output(finalResult.Weights, finalResult.Bias, inputs) ? &quot;Yes&quot; : &quot;No&quot;)}&quot;)
));
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing that will be nice about translating this into F# is that it has better support for defining ranges. In C#, we used &quot;Enumerable.Range&quot; but that only works with integers and so we then had to do some division. In F#, we're able to say &quot;define a range by starting at x and incrementing by y until you get to z&quot;. So we could replace this:</p>
<pre><code>const double startAt = 0;
const double endAt = 1;
const double increment = 0.25;
var range = Enumerable.Range(0, (int)((endAt - startAt) / increment) + 1).Select(value =&gt; value * increment);
</code></pre>
<p>.. with this:</p>
<pre><code>let range = { float 0 .. float 0.25 .. float 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>We could then translate the rest of the C# shown above in a like-for-like fashion into F# <em>or</em> we could get a tiny bit fancier with some code that I found on Stack Overflow that takes one set of values and transforms it by combining every value with other value (so if your input set was the numbers 1 and 2 then the output would be {1,1} and {1,2} and {2,1} and {2,2}). This is sometimes referred to as taking the &quot;cross product&quot; and is the same concept as doing a &quot;cross join&quot; in SQL.</p>
<p>The code to do it is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>// Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/482922/3813189
let crossproductWithSelf xs = seq { for x1 in xs do for x2 in xs do yield x1, x2 }
</code></pre>
<p>Using this means that our &quot;Display network generalisation&quot; summary code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>let crossproductWithSelf xs = seq { for x1 in xs do for x2 in xs do yield x1, x2 }
let calculatedResults =
    { float 0 .. float 0.25 .. float 1 }
    |&gt; crossproductWithSelf
    |&gt; Seq.map (fun (x, y) -&gt;
        x.ToString() + &quot;,\t&quot; +
        y.ToString() + &quot;,\t&quot; +
        (if (Output finalResult.Weights finalResult.Bias [x; y]) then &quot;Yes&quot; else &quot;No&quot;)
    )
printfn &quot;&quot;
printfn &quot;X,\tY,\tOutput&quot;
printfn &quot;%s&quot; (String.concat Environment.NewLine calculatedResults)
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty neat and tidy, I think!</p>
<h3>Done! What's next?</h3>
<p>Phew! Well that felt like quite a lot of work. Getting to grips with a new language can be mentally taxing, particularly when it involves a new paradigm (like making the leap from OOP to functional programming) and I think that that's why it's taken me several attempts at getting started with F# to even get this far.</p>
<p>And although this is a good start, the &quot;machine learning&quot; aspect of the Single Layer Perceptron is very basic and it should be fun to try to dig a little deeper and attempt something more complicated. To that end, I have a few more posts that I'd like to write that will explain how to train a neural network (that has more layers than just the input and output layers) using the Backpropagation Algorithm and then use this to recognise handwritten digits from the famous <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> image database.</p>
<p>As with the code here, I will be starting with C# from the <a href="http://www.robosoup.com/blog">Robosoup blog</a> and translating it into a functional style before rewriting it as F#. I think that it's exciting stuff!</p>
<p>One more thing - in case you're curious to see the complete F# code that was scattered through this post, here it is:</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I know C# well and I want to learn F#. I want to wrap my head about some of the underlying algorithms that enable the machine learning that seems so prevalent in the world today (voice recognition, computer vision, sales prediction, semantic analysis, translation). I'm going to try to do both together and prove to myself that I have a good understanding of them both by writing about it.</p>
<h3>The lure of F#</h3>
<p>For a few years now, I've been wanting to have a proper crack at learning F#. There's a lot about it that sounds very appealing - immutability-by-default and better representation / handling of null values while still being able to use Visual Studio and use the .NET framework library (as well as other .NET assemblies). I've tried a couple of times in the past but without any concrete project to work on, I find that I struggle to motivate myself without a target to work towards that is more tangible than &quot;feel like I've learned a bit of a new language&quot;.</p>
<p>To address this, I've decided to combine learning-some-F# with learning-some-machine-learning-basics so that I have a more solid goal. As I go, I thought that I'd write a few posts about the process for two reasons; firstly, being able to explain something clearly is a good indicator that you understand it yourself and, secondly, there is a chance (admittedly slim!) that this might be useful to someone else in a similar position to me, who is familiar with C# and wants to get to grips with F# - I wouldn't even consider myself intermediately competent yet and so I'm still encountering the pain points of being an F# beginner and seeing how I deal with them might be helpful to others.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote <a href="/face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet">Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)</a>, which classified image regions using a linear support vector machine. This was technically a machine learning solution but it's only one particular algorithm and there are limitations to the sorts of problem that it can tackle. I want to work up to implementing a Back-Propagation Neural Network that will categorise hand written digits (0-9) but I'm going to start a little simpler.</p>
<p>While trying to decide how I was going to get started, I read (or scan-read, in many cases, if I'm being honest) what felt like hundreds of articles about neural networks. One of the issues with trying to learn something like this through the research of others is that the people writing about it already have a level of knowledge far above my own on the matter and it feels like there is a lot of knowledge that it assumed that the reader will have. Another issue is that there is often maths involved that can seem sufficiently complicated that it is off-putting. In my posts, I'm going to try to keep things as simple as possible (which may well mean brushing some &quot;whys&quot; under the carpet - leaving it as an exercise to the reader to find out more from other people, once the basics are understood). One series of posts that I <em>did</em> find very approachable, though, was on a site &quot;<a href="http://www.robosoup.com/">Robosoup</a>&quot; - which is for a consultancy based in London that specialise in machine learning. The first post in the series is &quot;<a href="http://www.robosoup.com/2008/09/the-single-layer-perceptron-c.html">The Single Layer Perceptron C#</a>&quot; and I'm actually going to start with some of the code there and the example data. I'm going to try to explain things my own way but much of the content here will owe a debt to that Robosoup article (I got in touch with John Wakefield at Robosoup and he said that he was happy for me share his code - rest assured that I'm not just stealing it without asking for permission first!).</p>
<h3>The Single Layer Perceptron</h3>
<p>The concept of an &quot;artificial neural network&quot; is, essentially, that there is a system of neurons that are connected together and that have a series of inputs that send signals into the system and which eventually get (somehow) transformed into a series of outputs. Each output represents a particular result. If, for example, the neural network was intended to categorise images then the inputs will all be derived from the image data in some way and there may be an output for &quot;dog&quot; and an output for &quot;cat&quot; and these output will end up with a stronger or weaker signal depending upon the input data. The connections between the neurons will have different &quot;weights&quot; and so different input values will somehow result in different outputs. These different weights will have to calculated as part of the network's &quot;training&quot;. This sort of description is often accompanied by complicated-looking diagrams such as this:</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/NeuralNetwork.jpg" alt="Neural Network" /></p>
<p><em>(Taken from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/7880912598/in/photostream/">Cesar Harada's Flickr</a> under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">license conditions</a>)</em></p>
<p>This raises a lot of questions and feels like far too complicated a place to start! (Though, in later posts, I <em>will</em> be talking about multi-layered multi-output neural networks similar to what is shown above).</p>
<p>The &quot;Single Layer Perceptron&quot; is simpler - it only has one input &quot;layer&quot; and one output &quot;layer&quot;, where a layer is a list of &quot;neurons&quot;. A neuron is something that takes an input value (a value from -1 to 1), multiplies it by a &quot;weight&quot; (also a value from -1 to 1) and then passes that value onto every node that it is connected to in the layer ahead of it. Pretty much the simplest possible network imaginable that would fit this description would be just two neurons in the input layer and a single neuron in the output layer. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SingleLayerPerceptron.png" alt="Simple Single Layer Perceptron" /></p>
<p>Now this might almost seem <em>too</em> simple! Can this really do anything useful? Well, actually, it's entirely possible to configure a network like this to act as a classifier for any data that is &quot;linearly separable&quot; in as many dimensions as there are inputs. This is already sounding like mumbo jumbo, so I'll go over those terms..</p>
<p>A &quot;classifier&quot; will look at its inputs and give a yes/no answer (for example, an &quot;is this a cat?&quot; classifier might look at a photograph and report whether there appears to be a cat in it or not).</p>
<p>&quot;Linearly separable&quot; is simplest to understand in 2D - if the data is plotted on a graph then it's &quot;linearly separable&quot; if it's possible to draw a straight line across the graph that puts all of the values for &quot;yes&quot; lie on one side and all inputs for &quot;no&quot; lie on the other side. When I wrote about linear support vector machines, I talked about a fictional decision history for a  manager, where they would give the go-ahead (or not) to a new feature based upon how much of it could be billed to Clients and what strategic value it had to the company.</p>

<p>This data <em>is</em> linearly separable because it's possible to draw a line on the graph where all of the data above gets a &quot;yes&quot; response and all of the data below gets a &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Some data sets will <em>not</em> fit this model and so are <em>not</em> linearly separable. That won't make it impossible to classify using a neural network but it <em>will</em> make it impossible for a perceptron to classify (without some form of processing of the data before classification - which is out of the scope of what I want to cover today).</p>
<p>2D data like this would involve a perceptron with two inputs. 3D data that is linearly separable would have all of its data points seperable by a plane in the 3D space - all points on one side would be &quot;yes&quot; and all points on the other would be &quot;no&quot;; this data would involve a perceptron with three inputs.</p>
<p>While it's not as easy to envisage this in more dimensions, the same principle holds. For this sort of multi-dimensional data, the additional dimensions tend to be additional measurable factors that are thought to have affected the outcome (for example, maybe the manager in the example above is predictably less likely to give the go-ahead to features on Monday and Tuesday because they're always snowed under with emails for those first two days of the week <em>and</em> they're less likely to sign off on things when they're hungry; that would mean that there would be four dimensions to consider, which would be &quot;amount of cost that can be put onto Clients&quot;, &quot;strategic value of the work&quot;, &quot;day of the week&quot; and &quot;time since last ate&quot; - these four dimensions would require a perceptron with four inputs to model the data).</p>
<h3>Training a perceptron</h3>
<p>I said above that it's possible to <em>configure</em> a network to act as a classifier for linearly separable data. All that is required to configure the network is to assign the weight0 and weight1 values (at least, that is the case for 2D data - since each input has its own weight value then 2D data requires two inputs but if the input is three dimensional then there will be three weight values that must be set and if there were four dimensions then there would be four weight values, etc..). When it is correctly configured, it will be possible to apply any values to the input neurons and to get a single output value. If this output value is higher than a particular threshold then the output will be considered a positive response and otherwise it will be considered a negative response.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SingleLayerPerceptron-ManagerDecision.png" alt="Simple Single Layer Perceptron for predicting Manager Decisions" /></p>
<p>Returning to the Manager Decision data, one of the inputs will be for the &quot;amount of cost that can be put onto Clients&quot; while the other will be the &quot;strategic value of the work&quot;. For the data and the code that I'm going to look at further down, all inputs and outputs are in the 0-1 range (this is convenient enough for &quot;amount of cost that can be put onto Clients&quot; but it may be more difficult in the real world to fit all features into a 0-1 range for &quot;strategic value of the work&quot; - but since that data is just a fictional example, we don't need to worry about that too much).</p>
<p>The question, then, is <em>how</em> should we determine the weights for each neuron? This is where the &quot;machine learning&quot; part comes into it. What we're going to do is &quot;train&quot; a network by using historical data.</p>
<p>At its essence, the way that a trained network like this is produced is by -</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting all of the weights to be random values between 0 and 1</li>
<li>Passing all of the historical data (aka &quot;training data&quot;) through it and, for each &quot;pattern&quot; (which is the name given to a series of inputs)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Calculating the &quot;local error&quot; (the error for that particular pattern)</li>
<li>Adjusting the weights based upon this local error</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Taking the &quot;total error&quot; or &quot;global error&quot; (the sum of all of the local errors from the training data) and either finding that it is less than a predetermined threshold (in which case the network training is considered complete - hurrah!) or going back to step 2</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of things to consider there - what <em>precisely</em> are the &quot;local errors&quot;, how are the weights adjusted each iteration and what threshold should we stop at? Let's work through each of those in order..</p>
<p>The local error for a particular pattern is how far away the output of the network is from the expected result. Since all of the input data has a yes/no expected output, we'll translate &quot;yes&quot; into 1 and &quot;no&quot; into 0. For each pattern, we take its inputs and set the input neurons with those values. Then we calculate the output for the network (by multiplying the first input by the first weight and the second input by the second weight and then adding those two values together). Then we compare this output value to the expected 1 or 0 - so, if we get 0.3 as the output value for the first pattern and we expected 1 then that's an error of 0.7 (since 0.3 is 0.7 away from the expected value of 1). If we get 0.6 for the output value for the second pattern and we expected 0 then that's an error of 0.6 (since 0.6 is 0.6 away from the expected value of 0).</p>
<p>In order to adjust the weights after each pattern has been run through the network, a fairly simple equation is used - each new weight is calculated using:</p>
<pre><code>weight[i] = weight[i] + (learningRate * localError * patternInput[i])
</code></pre>
<p>For this network, there are only two inputs and so there will only be two values for &quot;i&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;learning rate&quot; is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how quickly the weights change as the network is trained. Clearly, a value of 0 would mean that the weights <em>don't</em> change each iteration, which would be useless. The larger the value of the learning rate, the more that the weights will be adjusted each iteration - however, larger is not always better because the adjustments may swing too far each time and, instead of slowing homing in on a well-trained network, the weights may alternate back and forth and never significantly improve. In the example code that I'm going to look at, I'm using a learning rate of 0.1* but this is a value that you may wish to try playing with when experimenting with training - there seem to be many guidelines when it comes to machine learning and many sensible approaches to classes or problem but there aren't always hard and fast rules for all of the variables and there are often things to tweak here and there that may affect how quickly you get a result (or if you get one at all).</p>
<p>* <em>(To be honest, I've &quot;decided&quot; to use a learning rate of 0.1 because much of the initial C# code below comes from the <a href="http://www.robosoup.com/2008/09/the-single-layer-perceptron-c.html">Robosoup article</a> that I mentioned earlier and a 0.1 learning rate is used there!)</em></p>
<p>The acceptable &quot;global error&quot; is another &quot;tunable parameter&quot; in that a higher acceptable threshold should mean that training will complete more quickly but also that the resulting network will be less accurate. On the other hand, it may be impossible to train a network (particularly so simple a network as a single perceptron) to match all of the training data perfectly and so a reasonable threshold must be accepted. In the example code below, a network that perfectly matches the training data <em>is</em> possible and won't take long to train and so we'll aim for a zero global error.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go into any more detail about how you may set these tunable parameters (learning rate and global error threshold) because there's a <em>lot</em> of material to cover and I want to try to stick to practical concepts and code (<em>and</em> because I'm still not very confident that I've got a great system for deciding them!).</p>
<h3>Input bias</h3>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SingleLayerPerceptron-ManagerDecision-With-Bias.png" alt="Simple Single Layer Perceptron for predicting Manager Decisions (with bias node)" /></p>
<p>Using the training method described above, you will always get a line that cuts through the data at the point (0, 0). This would not work for the &quot;Manager Decision History&quot; graph because there is no way that a line starting at the bottom left of the graph could correctly cut through the data with all of the red points on one side and all of the green points on the other (on that graph all values are 0-1 and so the bottom left is the 0, 0 point).</p>
<p>A way to address this is to introduce an additional &quot;bias&quot; value. This is effectively like adding an additional neuron whose input value is always one and that has its own weight, just like every other input. Every time that a pattern is passed through the system while it is being trained, when the weights are adjusted, the bias should also be adjusted using the following formula:</p>
<pre><code>bias = bias + (learningRate * localError)
</code></pre>
<p><em>(The formula is basically the same as the weight-adjusting formula except that the &quot;patternInput[i]&quot; value is removed because the bias neuron's input value is always 1)</em></p>
<p>This bias value means that the line that separates the yes/no values no longer has to go through (0, 0) but it has no other effect on training process, other than there being more slightly more work to do (although, without it, we wouldn't be able to get an answer for many sets of data - so it's not really <em>more</em> work at all!).</p>
<p>I've just said that it would not be possible to train a simple network of this form for <em>some</em> data sets without a bias.. which begs the question &quot;for what data sets <em>should</em> a bias node be introduced?&quot; - I think that it makes sense to <em>always</em> include one since, presumably, you don't know what solution the neural net should produce and so you don't know whether or not it would strictly be necessary to have a bias. So it's better to err on the safe side. If the data does <em>not</em> require a bias then the trained network should end up with a small (ie. close to zero) bias value and it will have little impact.</p>
<p><em>(This &quot;input bias&quot; is very different to moral biases that can creep into machine learning predictions due to biases, that are often unintentionally included, in the training data - see &quot;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608986/forget-killer-robotsbias-is-the-real-ai-danger/">Forget Killer Robots—Bias Is the Real AI Danger</a>&quot;)</em></p>
<h3>From C# to F#..</h3>
<p>The format that I intend to follow for these posts is roughly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk about the theory (we've already done that today!)</li>
<li>Look at some fairly standard C# code</li>
<li>Look at making the C# code more functional by removing variable mutations (including loops)</li>
<li>Rewrite the &quot;functional C#&quot; in F#</li>
</ol>
<p>As an F# beginner, this is the approach that I've been using for trying to learn it - until I've internalised it further, it still feels like a big ask to take regular C# and rewrite it into idiomatic F# and so the &quot;functional C#&quot; stage helps me a lot. The syntax of F# is not that big of a deal but <em>thinking</em> in (functional) F# is still something that I'm working towards.</p>
<p><em>(It's worth noting that, for me, getting my head around F# and functional programming is the priority. Much of the C# that we'll be looking will be doing in-place mutations - which, arguably, is a good model for doing the processing that we'll be looking at when it's done on a single thread - and since we'll be moving to using immutable structures then there is a good chance that the performance will be worse in the final F# code. If that turns out to be the case, though, then I'm not going to worry about it. I think that performance concerns are for when you have a better grasp of the technology that you're working with and I'm not there yet with F# - so I don't mind if I end up with worse-performing code in the context of this post so long as I've learned a lot from writing it!)</em></p>

<p>This code is fairly straightforward and it goes through the steps that I described before:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set weights to be random values and the bias to be zero</li>
<li>Take each training data entry's input and calculate the output using the current weights (and bias), adjusting the weights (and bias) if the calculated output did not match the expected output</li>
<li>Compare the total error against a threshold (of zero) and go back to step 2 if it's too high</li>
</ol>
<p>The way that I'm going to change this code from &quot;regular&quot; (I would call it &quot;object oriented&quot; C# but the code shown here is probably closer to being &quot;procedural&quot;) to &quot;functional*&quot; C# is by looking for things that would seem out of place in functional code and replacing them.</p>
<p>* <em>(&quot;functional&quot; is often interpreted as meaning that you avoid side effects and avoid mutation - we can argue about that definition another day if you like but it's a good enough place to start for now!)</em></p>
<p>Immediately, the following things jump out at me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variables whose values are explicitly changed during processing (eg. &quot;iteration&quot; and &quot;globalError&quot;)</li>
<li>Variables whose values change as part of looping constructs (eg. &quot;i&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;)</li>
<li>The do..while loop will not be useful if values are not to be mutated with it and so that will need to be replaced with something else</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose the question, then, is <em>how</em> can we possibly write code like this <em>without</em> changing / mutating / updating values?</p>
<p>The first thing to recognise is that LINQ made a more functional style of processing much more mainstream within C# and seem less alien. Before LINQ, if you had an array of values and you wanted an array containing the squares of these values (contrived example, I know, but bear with me) then you may well have achieved this in a fairly procedural manner - eg.</p>
<pre><code>var values = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };
var squaredValues = new int[values.Length];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; values.Length; i++)
  squaredValues[i] = values[i] * values[i];
</code></pre>
<p>Each time the loop is executed, the value of &quot;i&quot; changes and the &quot;squareValues&quot; array is updated.</p>
<p>Until the for loop has been fully executed, the &quot;squaredValues&quot; array is only partially initialised.</p>
<p>Within the loop, it's technically possible to change the value of &quot;i&quot; and move it backwards or forwards (such as by throwing in a bonus &quot;i++&quot; to keep future code maintainers on their toes) and this can be the cause of potential coding errors in loops more complicated than the one shown here.</p>
<p>Since all we want to do is transform every single value in one array and create a new array from the results, it would be nice if we could be more descriptive in what we are trying to do and to remove some &quot;book keeping&quot; (such as tracking the &quot;i&quot; value using the for loop). This is what would happen if LINQ was used to perform the same work -</p>
<pre><code>var values = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };
var squaredValues = values
  .Select(value =&gt; value * value)
  .ToArray();
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is no mutation occurring here. Each time that the lambda that is passed to the &quot;Select&quot; method is called, a new &quot;value&quot; reference is created (unlike &quot;i&quot;, which was a single variable shared across each iteration of the loop).</p>
<p>This is one technique that will be useful to remove mutation from code.</p>
<p>Another is the &quot;Aggregate&quot; method for enumerating a list of items and reducing it to a single reference. To try to illustrate; if I had a collection of words and I wanted to get the <em>total number of words</em> and the <em>total number of letters</em> then I might write procedural code like this:</p>
<pre><code>static void ShowLetterAndWordCount(IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; words)
{
  var numberOfLetters = 0;
  var numberOfWords = 0;
  foreach (var word in words)
  {
    numberOfLetters += word.Length;
    numberOfWords++;
  }
  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Total number of letters: &quot; + numberOfLetters);
  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Total number of words: &quot; + numberOfWords);
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. or I could achieve the same thing without any mutating variables by using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>static void ShowLetterAndWordCount(IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; words)
{
  var summary = words.Aggregate(
    seed: new { NumberOfLetters = 0, NumberOfWords = 0 },
    func: (valueSoFar, nextWord) =&gt; new
    {
      NumberOfLetters = valueSoFar.NumberOfLetters + nextWord.Length,
      NumberOfWords = valueSoFar.NumberOfWords + 1
    }
  );
  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Total number of letters: &quot; + summary.NumberOfLetters);
  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Total number of words: &quot; + summary.NumberOfWords);
}
</code></pre>
<p>What &quot;Aggregate&quot; does is it takes a &quot;seed&quot; value and the first value of the list of items and combines them using the &quot;func&quot; lambda. It then takes this result and combines it with the <em>second</em> value of the list, also using the &quot;func&quot; lambda. It will then take <em>this</em> result and combines it with the <em>third</em> value of the list, etc.. until one final combined value is returned. In the code above, I've used an anonymous type for the seed (and so the final &quot;summary&quot; reference will also be an instance of that anonymous type and so have &quot;NumberOfLetters&quot; and &quot;NumberOfWords&quot; properties) but the seed can be a class or a primitive or any type that you need.</p>
<p>All of the &quot;book keeping&quot; required by the Aggregate method is handled by the method itself - there is no loop variable to worry about and there are no variables outside of the loop (such as &quot;numberOfLetters&quot; and &quot;numberOfWords&quot;) that must be tracked. You need only to tell it what the initial &quot;seed&quot; value should be and how it should combine the &quot;value so far&quot; with a single item from the input list.</p>
<p>This is the advantage that it has over the procedural version (which may initially appear &quot;less complicated&quot;) - you only need to consider what actually happens within a single operation and you don't have to look after any variables that must be maintained across the entire loop (which was the case with &quot;numberOfLetters&quot; and &quot;numberOfWords&quot; in the first version).</p>
<p>At its core, this means that the scope of variables is reduced and when they don't change (ie. they are immutable) there are less moving parts for you to mentally consider when trying to reason about any particular line of code.</p>
<p>I'm finding that the F# version of Aggregate (called &quot;fold&quot;) is a very powerful and useful technique and so having a good grasp on how it works is very useful. Just to make it <em>extra</em> clear (apologies if this is belabouring the point but Aggregate doesn't, in my experience, tend to be commonly used in C# and so it may not be familiar to some), here's another example:</p>
<pre><code>var values = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var sumOfValues = words.Aggregate(
  seed: 0,
  func: (valueSoFar, value) =&gt; valueSoFar + value
);
</code></pre>
<p>This will return 15 because it will just add all of the values together. It begins with a seed value of 0 and adds it to the first value (which is 1) to get 1. It then adds this &quot;value so far&quot; to the second value (which is 2) to get 3. It adds this to the third value (which is 3) to get 6 and adds this to the fourth value (which is 4) to get 10 and adds this to the fifth value (which is 5) to get 15.</p>
<p>Not a particularly useful piece of code - and one that could have been written more clearly as:</p>
<pre><code>var values = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var sumOfValues = words.Sum();
</code></pre>
<p>.. but hopefully it reinforces how the Aggregate method operates on data. And hopefully it makes it clear how powerful Aggregate can be because so many other operations may be built on top of it, such as Min or Max -</p>
<pre><code>static int? Min(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; values)
{
  return values.Aggregate(
    seed: (int?)null,
    func: (valueSoFar, nextValue) =&gt; (valueSoFar.HasValue &amp;&amp; valueSoFar &lt; nextValue)
      ? valueSoFar
      : nextValue
  );
}

static int? Max(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; values)
{
  return values.Aggregate(
    seed: (int?)null,

<h3>To functional code.. one step at a time</h3>
<p>Back to the Single Layer Perceptron code.. The way that I'm approaching this is to take one logical section of code and replace the procedural style of code with functional constructs.</p>
<p>The first that I'll tackle is the do..while loop and the mutation of the outer &quot;iteration&quot;, &quot;weights&quot;, &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;globalError&quot; variables.</p>
<p>This will be straightforward if we use the Aggregate method where the &quot;value so far&quot; contains a &quot;Weights&quot; array, a &quot;Bias&quot; value and a &quot;GlobalError&quot; value that will be re-calculated each iteration.</p>
<p>The input list passed to Aggregate will be an incrementing list of integers representing the current iteration number. The &quot;func&quot; lambda will take the previous Weights / Bias / GlobalError state and calculate the <em>next</em> Weight / Bias / GlobalError state. If the &quot;previousState&quot; already has a low enough GlobalError then the &quot;func&quot; lambda won't have to do any more calculating and can just return the previousState reference immediately (meaning that we don't have to do any more work and we can just let Aggregate finish as many iterations as it is configured to do so until the Aggregate call completes - if that sounds a bit unclear then hopefully it will make more sense after you see the code and I talk more about it below).</p>
<pre><code>const double learningRate = 0.1;
const int maxNumberOfIterationsToPerform = 100; // See notes below code

var finalResult = Enumerable.Range(0, maxNumberOfIterationsToPerform)
  .Aggregate(
    seed: new
    {
      Weights = new[] { r.NextDouble(), r.NextDouble() },
      Bias = 0d,
      GlobalError = double.MaxValue
    },
    func: (previousState, iteration) =&gt;
    {
      // The network is already trained - no more calculations required
      if (previousState.GlobalError == 0)
        return previousState;

      var weights = previousState.Weights;
      var bias = previousState.Bias;
      var globalError = 0d;
      for (var p = 0; p &lt; trainingData.Length; p++)
      {
        // Calculate output
        var inputs = trainingData[p].Item1;
        var output = Output(weights, bias, inputs[0], inputs[1]) ? 1 : -1;

        // Calculate error
        var expected = trainingData[p].Item2;
        var localError = (expected ? 1 : -1) - output;
        if (localError != 0)
        {
          // Update weights (taking a copy of the weights array rather than altering its values)
          weights = weights.ToArray();
          for (var i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
          {
            weights[i] += learningRate * localError * inputs[i];
          }
          bias += learningRate * localError;
        }

        // Convert error to absolute value
        globalError += Math.Abs(localError);
      }
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, globalError);
      return new { Weights = weights, Bias = bias, GlobalError = globalError };
    }
  );
</code></pre>
<p>(You may notice that I also changing &quot;learningRate&quot; from being a variable to be a const - since this will never change, it makes sense).</p>
<p>I've had to make a compromise in how I've written this code - I've had to specify a &quot;maxNumberOfIterationsToPerform&quot; value because the Aggregate method has no way to say &quot;stop processing now, we have an answer that we're happy with&quot;. This is why there is the check at the top of the &quot;func&quot; lambda that says &quot;if previousState's GlobalError is low enough then do no more calculation&quot; - the Aggregate method will keep running through <em>every single value</em> in the input list. But how do we know that 100 iterations will be enough to get a zero Global Error? We don't!</p>
<p>What would be really helpful would be if we could have a variation of Aggregate that returns an <strong>IEnumerable</strong> of all of the intermediate calculation states (all of the &quot;previousState&quot; values) so that we could stop enumerating as soon as one of them has a GlobalError of zero - that way we wouldn't have to limit ourselves to a low maxNumberOfIterationsToPerform value. Something that would let us write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>const double learningRate = 0.1;

var finalResult = Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue)
  .AggregateAndReturnIntermediateStates(
    seed: new
    {
      // Same as in earlier code sample..
    },
    func: (previousState, iteration) =&gt;
    {
      // Same as in earlier code sample but without the need to check GlobalError..
    }
  )
  .First(state =&gt; state.GlobalError == 0);
</code></pre>
<p>I searched through the LINQ and the F# library documentation and I couldn't find anything in LINQ that I could use to do this but I <em>did</em> find something in F# called &quot;scan&quot;. To implement it as a LINQ-esque C# extension method, though, is simple. If we start by considering what an implementation of Aggregate would look like:</p>
<pre><code>public static TAccumulate Aggregate&lt;TSource, TAccumulate&gt;(
  this IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; source,
  TAccumulate seed,
  Func&lt;TAccumulate, TSource, TAccumulate&gt; func)
{
  var valueSoFar = seed;
  foreach (var value in source)
    valueSoFar = func(valueSoFar, value);
  return valueSoFar;
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. we need only to change the return type from <strong>TAccumulate</strong> to <strong>IEnumerable&lt;TAccumulate&gt;</strong> and to throw in some &quot;yield return&quot; magic to produce &quot;Scan&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;TAccumulate&gt; Scan&lt;TSource, TAccumulate&gt;(
  this IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; source,
  TAccumulate seed,
  Func&lt;TAccumulate, TSource, TAccumulate&gt; func)
{
  yield return seed;

  var valueSoFar = seed;
  foreach (var value in source)
  {
    valueSoFar = func(valueSoFar, value);
    yield return valueSoFar;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means that I can now write:</p>
<pre><code>const double learningRate = 0.1;

var finalResult = Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue)
  .Scan(
    seed: new
    {
      // Same as in earlier code sample..
    },
    func: (previousState, iteration) =&gt;
    {
      // Same as in earlier code sample (but still without the need to check GlobalError)..
    }
  )
  .First(state =&gt; state.GlobalError == 0);
</code></pre>
<p>Hurrah! That's a good step forward!</p>
<p>Now I need to tackle the inner section:</p>
<pre><code>var weights = previousState.Weights;
var bias = previousState.Bias;
var globalError = 0d;
for (var p = 0; p &lt; trainingData.Length; p++)
{
  // Calculate output
  var inputs = trainingData[p].Item1;
  var output = Output(weights, bias, inputs[0], inputs[1]) ? 1 : -1;

  // Calculate error
  var expected = trainingData[p].Item2;
  var localError = (expected ? 1 : -1) - output;
  if (localError != 0)
  {
    // Update weights (taking a copy of the weights array rather than altering its values)
    weights = weights.ToArray();
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
    {
      weights[i] += learningRate * localError * inputs[i];
    }
    bias += learningRate * localError;
  }

  // Convert error to absolute value
  globalError += Math.Abs(localError);
}

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, globalError);
return new { Weights = weights, Bias = bias, GlobalError = globalError };
</code></pre>
<p>I'm going to start from the inside and work outward this time. The first thing that I want to get rid of is the loop that is used to update weights. What this loop is effectively doing is walking through two arrays (&quot;weights&quot; and &quot;inputs&quot;) and performing an operation on a single pair of items from each (each loop iteration, we do something with one weight value and one input value).</p>
<p>This is just what the &quot;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd267698(v=vs.110).aspx">Zip</a>&quot; LINQ function does and so we can use that here. We'll replace:</p>
<pre><code>// Update weights (taking a copy of the weights array rather than altering its values)
weights = weights.ToArray();
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
{
  weights[i] += learningRate * localError * inputs[i];
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. with this:</p>
<pre><code>weights
  .Zip(inputs, (weight, input) =&gt; weight + (learningRate * localError * input))
  .ToArray();
</code></pre>
<p>To maker the &quot;inner section&quot; simpler, I'm going to hide that logic into a function:</p>
<pre><code>private static double[] UpdateWeights(double[] weights, double learningRate, double localError, double[] inputs)
{
  if (localError == 0)
    return weights;

  return weights
    .Zip(inputs, (weight, input) =&gt; weight + (learningRate * localError * input))
    .ToArray();
}
</code></pre>
<p>I've also pulled the &quot;is localError zero&quot; check into the method. It feels a little unnecessary when there are only two weights and two inputs but this new version of the weight-updating code may be called with any number of inputs and so it may make sense to avoid looping through them all when the localError is zero (because we won't be making any changes to the weights in that case).</p>
<p>The next thing to do is to get rid of the other for-loop and the values that it mutates on each iteration. This part:</p>
<pre><code>var weights = previousState.Weights;
var bias = previousState.Bias;
var globalError = 0d;
for (var p = 0; p &lt; trainingData.Length; p++)
{
  // Apply current pattern and alter weights, bias and globalError accordingly..
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we group the &quot;weights / bias / globalError&quot; values into a single value then we can replace this with an Aggregate call, like we saw earlier:</p>
<pre><code>var resultForIteration = trainingData.Aggregate(
  seed: new { Weights = previousState.Weights, Bias = previousState.Bias, GlobalError = 0d },
  func: (stateSoFar, pattern) =&gt;
  {
    // Apply current pattern and calculate new weights, bias and globalError values..

    // .. and return new object wrapping these values
    return new { Weights = newWeights, Bias = newBias, GlobalError = newGlobalError },
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>Before I pull it all together, I want to make a small change to the &quot;Output&quot; function - the current version only works if there are precisely two inputs and two weights but the &quot;UpdateWeights&quot; function from a moment ago works with any number of inputs and so I think that &quot;Output&quot; should too. So we'll replace this:</p>
<pre><code>private static bool Output(double[] weights, double bias, double x, double y)
{
  var sum = (x * weights[0]) + (y * weights[1]) + bias;
  return (sum &gt;= 0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. with this:</p>
<pre><code>private static bool Output(double[] weights, double bias, double[] inputs)
{
  var sum = inputs.Zip(weights, (input, weight) =&gt; input * weight).Sum() + bias;
  return (sum &gt;= 0);
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>(Note that using &quot;Zip&quot; again means that we don't have to resort to any for loops)</em></p>
<p>Combining all of this, the network-training code becomes the following:</p>
<pre><code>const double learningRate = 0.1;

var finalResult = Enumerable.Range(0, int.MaxValue)
  .Scan(
    seed: new
    {
      Weights = new[] { r.NextDouble(), r.NextDouble() },
      Bias = 0d,
      GlobalError = double.MaxValue
    },
    func: (previousState, iteration) =&gt;
    {
      var resultForIteration = trainingData.Aggregate(
        seed: new { Weights = previousState.Weights, Bias = previousState.Bias, GlobalError = 0d },
        func: (stateSoFar, pattern) =&gt;
        {
          var output = Output(stateSoFar.Weights, stateSoFar.Bias, pattern.Item1) ? 1 : -1;
          var localError = (pattern.Item2 ? 1 : -1) - output;
          return new
          {
            Weights = UpdateWeights(stateSoFar.Weights, learningRate, localError, pattern.Item1),
            Bias = stateSoFar.Bias + (learningRate * localError),
            GlobalError = stateSoFar.GlobalError + Math.Abs(localError)
          };
        }
      );
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration {0}\tError {1}&quot;, iteration, resultForIteration.GlobalError);
      return resultForIteration;
    }
  )
  .First(state =&gt; state.GlobalError &lt;= 0);
</code></pre>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is to change the &quot;Display network generalisation&quot; code to remove the for loops from there too -</p>
<pre><code>for (double x = 0; x &lt;= 1; x += .25)
{
  for (double y = 0; y &lt;= 1; y += .25)
  {
    var output = Output(weights, bias, new[] { x, y });
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0},\t{1},\t{2}&quot;, x, y, output ? &quot;Yes&quot; : &quot;No&quot;);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The natural thing would seem to be to replace those loops with Enumerable.Range calls.. however, &quot;Range&quot; only works <strong>int</strong> values and we need to use <strong>double</strong> in order to increment by 0.25 each time. We could write a new &quot;Range&quot; extension method that would take <strong>double</strong> values or we could just workaround the limitation. If we want the values 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 then that's five distinct values. The number of items may be calculated by taking the end value, subtracting the start value, dividing by the increment and then adding one (to ensure that we get the start value <em>and</em> the end value).</p>
<p>In this case, that would be ((1 - 0) / 0.25) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.</p>
<p>We can do that in code like this:</p>
<pre><code>const double startAt = 0;
const double endAt = 1;
const double increment = 0.25;
var range = Enumerable.Range(0, (int)((endAt - startAt) / increment) + 1)
  .Select(value =&gt; value * increment);
</code></pre>
<p>We then want to &quot;cross join&quot; range with itself so that we loop through every (x, y) combination. We can do that with creative use of &quot;SelectMany&quot; -</p>
<pre><code>var xyPairs = range.SelectMany(value =&gt; range, (x, y) =&gt; new[] { x, y });
</code></pre>
<p>And now that nested for-loop may be replaced by this:</p>
<pre><code>const double startAt = 0;
const double endAt = 1;
const double increment = 0.25;
var range = Enumerable.Range(0, (int)((endAt - startAt) / increment) + 1)
  .Select(value =&gt; value * increment);
var xyPairs = range.SelectMany(value =&gt; range, (x, y) =&gt; new[] { x, y });
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(
  Environment.NewLine,
  xyPairs.Select(inputs =&gt; $&quot;{string.Join(&quot;\t&quot;, inputs)}\t{(Output(finalResult.Weights, finalResult.Bias, inputs) ? &quot;Yes&quot; : &quot;No&quot;)}&quot;)
));
</code></pre>
<p>That's the final piece of the convert-to-functional-code puzzle. Now we just need to translate it into F#!</p>
<h3>Sidebar: &quot;Function&quot; vs &quot;Method&quot;</h3>
<p>I find that in languages that are thought to be object oriented, the words &quot;function&quot; and &quot;method&quot; are commonly used interchangeably. Since beginning to become interested in so-called &quot;functional programming&quot;, I've tried to find out whether there is a definitive or accepted difference between the two (after all, it's called <em>functional</em> programming rather than <em>methodical</em> programming, so surely <em>someone</em> thought that there was a difference!).</p>
<p>A few times, I've heard that the difference is that a &quot;function&quot; should not have any side effects and so should always return the same value given the same inputs. On the other hand, a &quot;method&quot; <em>may</em> cause side effects or rely upon ambient references - if the code writes to disk or reads <strong>DateTime.Now</strong> then it's not &quot;pure&quot; (where &quot;pure&quot; means that it relies only upon its arguments and does not produce any side effects - it <em>only</em> produces a return value and does not manipulate anything else) and so should be described as being part of a <em>method</em> rather than part of a <em>function</em>. Most recently I've seen it described in <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/222378/204464">this Software Engineering Stack Exchange answer</a>.</p>
<p>I try to use the word &quot;function&quot; only when it is known to be a pure function and a &quot;method&quot; otherwise (when it either <em>definitely</em> causes / relies upon side effects or if it's not clear). I still get it wrong from time to time (for example, I've been referring to LINQ &quot;methods&quot; in this post and we can probably presume that they are pure functions in most cases) but I'm still in the process of trying to internalise this terminology while I'm trying to internalise writing a more &quot;functional&quot; style of code for writing F#.</p>
<h3>Writing F# code</h3>
<p>If you've read this far then you may be detecting an unexpectedly abrupt end to the post judging by your browser's scrollbar!</p>
<p>Originally, I had intended to include all of the above content <em>and</em> go into how precisely to translate the functional C# code into F# but it quickly became clear that the post would be insanely large (I've written my fair share of monster posts in the past and I think that the time has come to put an end to them - this one's already pretty hefty).</p>
<p>Cliffhanger!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>My next post will jump straight into F#. I will assume zero prior knowledge of the language itself but I also want to proceed at a decent rate. Hopefully this will mean that you won't get bored if you already have a little exposure to F# (or maybe it will be the worst of both worlds and be too slow for F# novices but too fast for those who've never seen it before). Let's wait and see*!</p>
<p>* <em>(Should you be desperately excited and dying for part two, rest assured that it's already written and just needs a thorough proof-read - so it should be published early next week at the latest)</em></p>
<p>I'm not sure how many posts there will be in the series in total but the Single Layer Perceptron is just the first model that I want to cover before moving onto the Back Propagation Neural Network model and then onto the Multi-Output variation (which will be necessary in order to classify hand written digits from 0-9 as opposed to being a simple yes/no classifier). Although I said that performance is not my primary concern for this playing-with-F# process, there are a couple of interesting things that I'd like to talk about on that front. So there should be a lot to come over the next few months!</p>

        <h3 class="PostDate">12 February 2017</h3><h2><a id="face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet" href="/face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet">Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)</a></h2>
<p>I've always been intrigued as to how facial detection and recognition is handled by computers. It's one of the few effects that is seen in Hollywood films that seems convincing - where someone is tracked through a city, live CCTV feeds finding their face as they move from one street to the next. For a more mundane example, facial detection has been built into digital cameras and smartphones for quite some time now (my phone puts green squares around faces in photos and, I presume, uses this information to decide where to focus).</p>
<p>I knew literally nothing about the subject to begin with and so I hit the internet and tried to find out everything I could about it. Turns out that there's a <em>lot</em> that's been written about this, with various different methods and approaches discussed and documented. It's an interesting subject because it's been so affected by the rate of change in technology - for example, the digital cameras that introduced it had access to much less processing power than modern day devices do. I've had a hard time finding definitive information about when digital cameras started offering this facility but I'm getting a rough impression that it's over the last ten years (citation needed!) - when you think about how phones, for example, have changed in ten years in terms of their power.. well, it's a lot!</p>
<p>Having said that, digital cameras (and web cams) can take some shortcuts and only concern themselves with subjects that are facing directly towards the camera, since these are more likely to be subjects that are of interest - it's not as important to worry about people looking at ninety degrees from the camera lens, for example). So, straight away, it's apparent there are going to different techniques and different requirements for different situations and some will be more expensive than others.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is going to be an ongoing investigation for me; so far I've only managed to implement facial detection functionality and not facial <em>recognition</em> (once a face has been detected, is it someone from a database of known faces?). I thought I'd present what I have at this point, though - if it's interesting to me then maybe it will be of interest to other people! And I couldn't find much material out there that goes into enough detail that it's reproducible without being a really dense research paper (and certainly not ones that make it easy to reproduce their findings using C#), so I thought that I'd try to fill that gap. There <em>are</em> articles out there about using libraries to do all the hard work for you - but where's the fun in that?! I want to know <em>how</em> the code I'm calling is working.</p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<p>My current code (<a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition">github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition</a>) identifies faces in photos by using two passes. First, it looks for regions of skin that have holes (that we presume may be eyes and a nose) and that are very roughly the right proportions to be a face.</p>
<p>The image content from these regions is passed through a &quot;linear support vector machine&quot;, which will have been trained to classify a potential image region as a face or as not-a-face.</p>
<p>Before embarking on this adventure, I had no idea what a &quot;support vector machine&quot; even was. If you don't either then maybe you'll come away from this feeling like you know a little something about machine learning. I know that I did! And &quot;machine learning&quot; is a phrase that I've been interested in finding out more about for quite some time now, it seems like it's cropping up everywhere! I have a strong feeling that trying to perform facial <em>recognition</em> is going to involve even more magical sounding terms - such as &quot;deep convolutional neural network&quot; - but that's going to have to wait for another day, it's one (baby) step at a time for me.</p>
<h3>The &quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot;</h3>
<p>In a past life, I worked in IT Support and, one day, I was asked by the Head Clinician why I'd been printing out porn. Which confused me considerably since I had most certainly <em>not</em> been printing out explicit material. There had been complaints about the colour tone and contrast of a new colour laser printer and so I'd sent a full-page test image to it that included greyscale content, colour grids and images that contained a lot of skin. Apparently printing out pictures with lots of skin in it raises eyebrows and maybe it's for similar reasons that a research paper entitled &quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot; amusingly sounds a touch pervy (or maybe that's just a British thing.. we do love to keep most of our naked-skin-unvealing behind closed doors - because it's so cold!).</p>
<p>This &quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot; paper was published by Margaret M. Fleck and David A Forsyth and is available at <a href="http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/naked-skin.html">http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/naked-skin.html</a>. It essentially describes an algorithm to detect regions of skin in an image. In 1997, another paper &quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090723024922/http:/geocities.com/jaykapur/face.html">Face Detection in Color Images</a>&quot; described starting with that skin-tone-identifying approach and then using it to try to find solid regions of skin that have a few holes in, on the basis that this is <em>probably</em> a face (where the holes are eyes, nose, mouth).</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/TigerWoods.gif" alt="Tiger Woods" /></p>
<p><em>Note: That &quot;Face Detection in Color Images&quot; link use the <a href="http://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to make available a GeoCities page. Maybe it's a sad reminder that there was actually worthwhile content on GeoCities as well as the many harshly-coloured-and-bizarely-animated eye-watering monstrosities. By the way, if you (quite rightly, imho) think that the web has lost something by having less places for people to upload content for free then check out <a href="https://neocities.org/browse">NeoCities</a> - it's awesome because it makes that possible again (and all the good and bad that comes with it)!</em></p>
<p>&quot;Face Detection in Color Images&quot; uses an example image of Tiger Woods and so I will use that same image while I discuss what I've done, based upon these articles.</p>
<p>There are a set of steps that are followed when trying to identify faces in an image:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scale the image down (depending upon its size)</li>
<li>Avoid desaturation by bring colour down values so that the minimum is true zero</li>
<li>Transform RGB colours into the RG/BY colour space, alongside an Intensity spectrum</li>
<li>Calculate &quot;texture amplitude&quot; across the image (how quickly intensity changes - the theory is that areas of skin have a relatively low texture amplitude)</li>
<li>Calculate hue and sauturation across the image (in order to identify areas that seem to be skin-coloured)</li>
<li>Combine the texture amplitude and hue data to identify areas of skin (the texture amplitude, hue and saturation must be within acceptable &quot;this is probably skin&quot; bounds)</li>
<li>Expand these areas of skin using a more relaxed texture amplitide / hue / saturation &quot;this is probably skin&quot; filter</li>
<li>Check these areas for holes - no holes (for non-skin facial features, such as eyes) means no face</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Any skin areas that are very small are ignored</li>
<li>Any skin areas that are extreme aspect ratios are ignored (very, very wide areas or very, very tall areas are probably not faces)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Expand the areas slightly because, even with the flexible-skin-filter expansions, the area that a human would identify as being a person's face is slightly larger than the areas identified by this algorithm</li>
</ol>
<h2>Calculating hue, saturation and texture amplitude (steps 1-7) to identify skin areas</h2>
<p>The first few steps are fairly simple. If the image is either taller or wider than 400px then it's shrunk down so that the largest side is 400px. &quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot; talks about applying &quot;smoothing&quot; (which I'll cover in a moment) relative to the size of the image but doesn't suggest any restrictions on the image size. &quot;Face Detection in Color Images&quot; mentions that only images up to 250px were used. With the test images I used, I found that capping at 400px provided a reasonable balance between identifying faces and not taking too long to process. I used the Tiger Woods image initially to try to ensure that my calculations were matching those described in &quot;Face Detection in Color Images&quot; but I used other test images (which will appear further down) to double-check that everything seemed to be working as expected. There are some differences between how Fleck &amp; Forsyth (&quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot;) and Kapur (&quot;Face Detection in Colour Images&quot;) perform the analysis and my test images led me to tweak a few parameters myself.</p>
<p>Fleck &amp; Forsyth recommend pulling down the colour values so that the minimum value is zero because it &quot;avoids potentially significant desaturation of opponent color values if the zero-response is far from zero&quot;. What this means is that the darkest parts of an image are probably not &quot;true black&quot; (ie. RGB 0, 0, 0) and the theory is that we should get better results if everything is adjusted down so that the darkest colour <em>is</em> black. In practice, I look for the lowest of any of the R, G or B values from any pixel in the image and subtract that value <em>from</em> every R, G and B value across all pixels in the image.</p>
<p>Next, I generate &quot;RgByI&quot; values for every pixel. This a trio of values; an RG (red-green) spectrum value, a BY (blue-yellow) spectrum value and an intensity. Since I'm going to spend a lot of time taking the pixels from an image and loading them into a 2D array and then performing a range of operations on them, I've written a <strong>DataRectangle&lt;T&gt;</strong> class that makes this easier. When I first read the data from an image, the pixels are loaded and used to populate a <strong>DataRectangle</strong> of RGB values. When I need to get RgByI values from them, I can do the following (using Kapur's formulae from &quot;Face Detection in Colour Images) -</p>
<pre><code>var rgByIValues = colourData.Transform(colour =&gt;
{
    Func&lt;byte, double&gt; L = x =&gt; (105 * Math.Log10(x + 1));
    return new IRgBy(
        rg: L(colour.R) - L(colour.G),
        by: L(colour.B) - ((L(colour.G) + L(colour.R)) / 2),
        i: (L(colour.R) + L(colour.B) + L(colour.G)) / 3
    );
});
</code></pre>
<p>In order to reduce unhelpful detail in the image somewhat, the RgByI values have a &quot;windowing median filter&quot; applied to them. From &quot;Face Detection in Colour Images&quot; -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rg and By matrices are then filtered with a windowing median filter .. with sides of length 4*SCALE. The SCALE value is calculated as being the closest integer value to (height+width)/320</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(The &quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot; paper recommends using 2*SCALE for the RG and BY values, which I have gone with because I found the results to be just as accurate and it's less computational work than 4*SCALE)</em></p>
<p>To do this, you go through every pixel and take its value and the values from the surrounding pixels, sort them, take the middle value (the &quot;median&quot;) and use that as the new value for the current pixel. The idea is that this reduces noise by discarding any outlier pixel colours in a given range. I take a square block around where the initial pixel is but it would probably be better to approximate a circular area if the media filter radius is large (in my filter, it's never more than three).</p>
<p>After smoothing the RG/BY data, their values are combined to generate hue and saturation -</p>
<pre><code>var smoothedHues = smoothedRG.CombineWith(
    smoothedBY,
    (rg, by) =&gt; new
    {
        Hue = RadianToDegree(Math.Atan2(rg, by)),
        Saturation = Math.Sqrt((rg * rg) + (by * by))
    }
);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SkinMaskGeneration-Hue.png" alt="Hue" /><br />
<img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SkinMaskGeneration-Saturation.png" alt="Saturation" /></p>
<p>The two images here are the hue and saturation values generated from the original image.</p>
<p>In order to generate greyscale images, I had to translate the hue and saturation values into the 0-255 range. The hue values will be in the range of -180 to +180 degrees so I just added 180 and then divided by 2. The saturation values are always positive and won't exceed 0-255 if multiplied by 2, so I just did that.</p>
<p>Generating texture amplitude is more complicated. We start with the intensity values from the RgByI data. We then run that through a median filter of 2 * SCALE and calculate the difference between every point in the median filter result and the original intensity. Finally, we run the result of the calculation through a median filter of 3 * SCALE. It may be clearer with some code -</p>
<pre><code>var smoothedIntensity = rgByIValues.MedianFilter(
    value =&gt; value.I,
    2 * scale
);
var differenceBetweenOriginalIntensityAndSmoothedIntensity = rgByIValues.CombineWith(
    smoothedIntensity,
    (x, y) =&gt; Math.Abs(x.I - y)
);
var textureAmplitude = differenceBetweenOriginalIntensityAndSmoothedIntensity.MedianFilter(
    value =&gt; value,
    3 * scale
);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SkinMaskGeneration-TextureAmplitude.png" alt="Texture Amplitude" /></p>
<p><em>(Note that the values 2 and 3 in the above code are much lower than Kapur suggests - 8*SCALE and 12*SCALE - but the median filtering algorithm that I threw together was very slow using the higher values and using lower values - which meant that the processing completed much more quickly - did not seem to affect the outcomes)</em></p>
<p>Hopefully it's apparent that around the lower face there is low texture amplitude. Texture amplitude is higher around the facial features but that's to expected. There is low texture amplitude elsewhere in the image (particularly in the sky behind him, the texture is very smooth there and so the texture amplitude is <em>very</em> low) but what we're going to look for is areas that appear to be skin in hue/saturation <em>and</em> in texture amplitude.</p>
<p>Now that we have all of the information required to guess whether a given pixel is within the acceptable bounds of &quot;probably skin&quot;, we can create a skin mask (a <strong>DataRectangle&lt;bool&gt;</strong>) -</p>
<pre><code>var skinMask = smoothedHues
    .CombineWith(textureAmplitude, (hs, t) =&gt; new
    {
        Hue = hs.Hue,
        Saturation = hs.Saturation,
        TextureAmplitude = t
    })
    .Transform(hst =&gt;
    {
        return (
            ((hst.Hue &gt;= 105) &amp;&amp; (hst.Hue &lt;= 160) &amp;&amp; (hst.Saturation &gt;= 10) &amp;&amp; (hst.Saturation &lt;= 60)) ||
            ((hst.Hue &gt;= 160) &amp;&amp; (hst.Hue &lt;= 180) &amp;&amp; (hst.Saturation &gt;= 30) &amp;&amp; (hst.Saturation &lt;= 30))
        )
        &amp;&amp; (hst.TextureAmplitude &lt;= 5);
    });
</code></pre>
<p>This is another point at which I have added my own tweaks to the processing. There are slightly different ranges of acceptable hue / saturation / texture amplitude suggested by Fleck &amp; Forsyth than are suggested by Kaypur and I found that <em>I</em> wanted to change them a little based upon the test images that I was using.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SkinMask2.png" alt="Skin mask" /></p>
<p>The final step in generating the skin mask is to try to identify any skin areas just outside the identified mask. I've used the approach suggested by Kapur, who recommends it because it &quot;helps to enlarge the skin map regions to include skin/background border pixels, regions near hair or other features, or desaturated areas&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea is that we look at negative values in the <strong>DataRectangle&lt;bool&gt;</strong> skin mask and check whether any of the adjacent values is positive <em>and</em> if the colour of the pixels that resulted in the false value passes a more relaxed skin filter. The relaxed skin filter test demands only that the hue is within the range 110-180 and that the saturation is with 0-180 (the text amplitude is not considered). This expansion work is performed twice.</p>
<h3>Recognising skin objects (and checking for holes)</h3>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/SkinMask3.png" alt="Detailed skin mask" /></p>
<p>In order to get back some of the details that are within the skin mask areas, the original image is changed to greyscale and then the skin mask is combined with it to produce a new skin mask that is slightly more restrictive; any negative content from the skin mask remains negative while positive content is only allowed if the greyscale intensity is within an acceptable range. Everything from this point (including this step) comes from the &quot;Face Detection in Color Images&quot; article, since &quot;Naked People Skin Filter&quot; ends when the skin regions are detected (it has no interest in faces, specifically).</p>
<pre><code>skinMask = colourData.CombineWith(
    skinMask,
    (colour, mask) =&gt;
    {
        if (!mask)
            return false;
        var intensity = colour.ToGreyScale();
        return (intensity &gt;= 90) &amp;&amp; (intensity &lt;= 240);
    }
);
</code></pre>
<p>In order to turn this <strong>DataRectangle&lt;bool&gt;</strong> mask into groups of points (where each group represents a distinct area of skin), I used a variation of the &quot;Stack based implementation&quot; from this article: <a href="https://simpledevcode.wordpress.com/2015/12/29/flood-fill-algorithm-using-c-net/">Flood Fill algorithm (using C#.Net)</a>. If you're looking my code, it's the &quot;TryToGetPointsInObject&quot; method in the <a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition/blob/master/FaceDetection/FaceDetector.cs">FaceDetector.cs</a> class. I'm not stressing out about performance at this point, I just wanted to get things working and then considering measuring &amp; improving in the future - so finding a nice simple flood fill algorithm was very helpful (I'm not saying that it's <em>not</em> a well-performing method, I'm just saying that at this point in time it's not critically important to me one way or the other).</p>
<p>Any skin objects that are very small (have less than 64 * SCALE points) are ignored. What is slightly more complicated is to identify any completely enclosed holes in the skin object. But it's not <em>much</em> more complicated - the basic approach is, for each skin object, take a negative point within the bounds of the skin object and use the flood fill algorithm again; if the fill reaches the edges of the bounds then the negative point was not part of an enclosed hole. Then move on to the next negative point within the bounds that hasn't already been included in a flood fill operation and continue doing this until a fully enclosed hole is found that's larger than a given size (1 * SCALE).</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/TigerWoods-FaceDetected.png" alt="Tiger Woods' face detected" /></p>
<p>With the Tiger Woods image, we could actually stop here. It successfully identifies only his face as a possible face region. However, with other test images I used, some more work was required. I found that I could quite easily eliminate a few false positives by ignoring any regions that were obviously the wrong aspect ratio (either very long and shallow sections or very tall and narrow sections). I also found that, depending upon lighting or what background a face was against, sometimes the detection process up to this point would result in a region that is too tight over the facial features - expanding the matched area a little meant that the next filtering in the next stage would get better results.</p>
<p>The real problem, though, is false positives - the algorithm will often identify areas that are <em>not</em> faces.</p>
<h2>Applying this to other images</h2>
<p>I wanted to try applying this facial detection logic to some other images. I'd used the image from one of the articles so that I could try to produce intermediate images that looked similar to those in &quot;Face Detection in Color Images&quot; so that I could reassure myself that I was (at least approximately) doing things correctly as described. But now I wanted to try it on some other test images.</p>
<p>In my Pictures folder, some photos from an Easter weekend* night out I went to a couple of years ago jumped out at me. Initially, I only used them because they made me laugh but, on closer inspection, they're actually really useful for illustrating what the skin tone detection process (and the subsequent support vector machine classification) is good at and where their limitations come into play.</p>
<p>* <em>(which goes some way to explaining the eggs and the costumes.. the photos were put up on Facebook by a professional photographer, I hope he doesn't mind me reproducing them here - I tried getting in touch to ask but he didn't get back to me)</em></p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/EggMan.jpg" alt="Egg Man" /></p>
<p>Firstly, we have this fine gentleman. The skin tone pass has identified his face perfectly but it's also misidentified two regions that contain colours and textureus that the skin filter allows through.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/EggMan-SkinMask.jpg" alt="Egg Man Skin Mask" /></p>
<p>Looking at the generated skin mask (where each distinct skin object is filled with a different colour), it should be clear why this has happened.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/Group1.jpg" alt="Group Photo One" /></p>
<p>If we take another photo then another problem is apparent - with this group of people, there are lots of enclosed skin objects that have holes in that are being identified as faces but that are actually hands holding things.</p>
<p>Also, because we ignore regions that are very small, there is a limit to what faces the skin tone filter will identify. If you look closely at the group photo there is an undetected bearded face along the left edge (near the top) but I am happy for it to exclude him since I think that it is a reasonable compromise to prefer faces that are in the foreground. On the whole, it does a good job of detecting faces but it may also produce a lot of false positives.</p>
<p>So the next step is to try to find a way to filter these regions down further, to try to get rid of those pesky false positives. To do this, I went back to the internet. One of the pages that I found incredibly useful was the &quot;<a href="http://mccormickml.com/2013/05/09/hog-person-detector-tutorial/">HOG Person Detector Tutorial</a>&quot; by Chris McCormick. He introduces a popular and modern technique, touches on its history and then goes into an illustrated explanation of how to implement it. It's almost redundant me going over it again! .. but it's <em>my</em> blog and I'm talking about how <em>I</em> implemented it, so I'm going to start from the beginning anyway :)</p>
<p>At the very highest level, what we're going to do is this -</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a load of images that are known to be faces and a load of images that are known to <em>not</em> be faces - these sets of &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; images are our &quot;training data&quot;</li>
<li>Extract a load of numbers from each image - each image must be processed in a manner that results in them each producing the same amount of numbers (this is called &quot;feature extraction&quot;)</li>
<li>The resulting data (which is a big list of entries, one from each training image, where each entry is a list of features from that image and a boolean value for whether the image was a face or not) is used to train a &quot;Support Vector Machine&quot; (which I'll explain in a second)</li>
<li>Now that we have a trained SVM, we can use the same feature extraction process from step 2 on each of the sub-images generated by the skin tone detection process and the SVM should tell us whether each one is a face or not a face</li>
</ol>
<h3>So what <em>is</em> a Support Vector Machine?</h3>
<p>This is a concept that I had never heard of before, so I know first-hand what it's like trying to search around on the internet for a good description. The problem is that a lot of articles seem to be aimed at people who know at least <em>something</em> about machine learning and they go immediately to showing lots of formulae and talking about techniques that I'd never heard of. One example is &quot;<a href="http://crsouza.com/2010/04/27/kernel-support-vector-machines-for-classification-and-regression-in-c/">Kernel Support Vector Machines for Classification and Regression in C#</a>&quot; by César Souza (who wrote much, if not all, of the Accord.NET library - which I will be using later); this is a really well-written article that I appreciate now but it was on my &quot;come back to this when you know more&quot; list for quite a while after I first found it!</p>
<p>So I'm going to take a real beginner approach and try to describe it in a manner that would have helped me a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Firstly, an SVM tends to be a &quot;binary classifier&quot;. This means that it will be trained with data that is all categorised as either yes or no. After it has been trained, you may only ask it to classify further data as being a yes-or-no result. (Actually, there is a such a thing as a &quot;Multi-Class Support Vector Machine&quot; that can return a greater range than binary but it's not relevant here so I'm going to forget about it for now).</p>
<p><em>(Time for some graphs. Shout out to <a href="http://xkcdgraphs.com/">Create your own XKCD-style Graphs</a>, which helped me come up with what's below!)</em></p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/ManagerDecisionHistory.jpg" alt="Manager Decision History" /></p>
<p>To conjure up an example that almost sounds feasible, imagine that every development task at a software shop requires that its strategic benefit to the company be quantified, along with the percentage of the work that a customer is just dying to pay in order for it to be done (presuming that there <em>is</em> a customer who wants it and that it's not just a task for internal purposes). Since every task needs to have these pieces of information before your manager will decide whether or not the work will be scheduled, there exists historical records of estimated tasks which have two &quot;features&quot; (strategic value and percentage-that-will-be-immediately-paid-for-by-customers) and an outcome of either &quot;yes, it was done&quot; or &quot;no, we didn't do it&quot;.</p>
<p>If something is of high strategic value to us <em>and</em> it happens to be a feature that a customer is chomping at the bit for (and so will contribute significantly towards) then it seems like a dead cert that we should do it. Unfortunately, this is not a very common case.. More often, a customer will want something that is important to <em>them</em> specifically. This may not be something that is necessarily very easy to resell to other customers (which would give it more strategic value) or something that will help us deal with internal issues, such as scaleability or technical debt (developments that <em>do</em> help with those will also have higher strategic value).</p>
<p>It seems like there's a roughly linear correlation between a development's strategic value, the fraction that customer(s) are willing to immediately pay for it and whether the work got the go-ahead. It's like we could draw a line and everything above it tends to get the green light by our manager and everything below it gets rejected.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/ManagerDecisionHistory-Predictions.jpg" alt="Manager Decision History" /></p>
<p>An SVM is (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">wikipedia</a>), a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;model with associated learning algorithms.. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this boils down to is that we're essentially trying to come up with a formula to split those two sets of points. Then, when we get a new feature-pair (strategic value vs amount-customer-will-pay) we can plug those two numbers into the formula and work out which side of the line we're on (where one side means I-predict-yes and the other side means I-predict-no).</p>
<p>The hard work in the machine learning algorithm is working out <em>where</em> that line should go. Ideally, you want all historical &quot;yes&quot; results on one side and all historical &quot;no&quot; results on the other side. In some cases, though, this is not possible and there will be some outliers (remember that task that you had to do that seemed to have no strategic value, that no customer was willing to pay for and yet someone at one of those customer companies had convinced one of your directors to do it at as a favour...?). Whether there are any outliers or not, there are probably still many slight variations on what line could be drawn. It's common for an algorithm to try to arrange the line so that it is equally distant from the positive results as it is from the negative results but there are some variations on this theme. This is really what the magic is in this process - giving the computer the results and letting it find the best match.</p>
<h3>Higher dimension planes and non-linear methods</h3>
<p>In the above example, each data point only had two features which made it very easy to envisage on a 2D graph how they related to each other (which isn't surprising since it's an example I made up to illustrate that very point!). Sometimes, though, more data is required. It could be that you plotted strategic-value against amount-customer-will-pay and could see no correlation, though one <em>was</em> there - but hidden due to the interaction of another feature. Imagine if you find historical data that shows that a customer wanted to pay for a new feature and the feature was of reasonable strategic value but it wasn't authorised. Or if there were a bunch features with comparatively low value that <em>did</em> get the go-ahead. And if you realised that these were not outliers and that <em>lots</em> of results looked to be &quot;all over the place&quot;. Well, it could be that the reason that the high value work wasn't done was because the development team were already stacked out with important work. Whereas those low value jobs that <em>did</em> get done happened to come in during quiet periods where they could be easily slotted into the schedule. This would mean that there was actually a third factor at play; available developer resources.</p>
<p>What would be required to model this would be to include some quantified &quot;available developer resources&quot; value with each data point. With this additional information, we should be able to construct a useful prediction model. However, the points could no longer be plotted on a simple 2D graph - now they would have to be plotted in 3D space. And so the formula that would be produced from the training data would no longer draw a simple line, it would have to describe a plane that cuts through the 3D space (with the &quot;yes&quot; values on one side and the &quot;no&quot; values on the other).</p>
<p>If you had more than three features to each data point then you would no longer be able to draw a graph of it, your points would now live in the mysterious-sounding &quot;n-dimensional space&quot;. It's still possible to concoct a formula that divides the data point within that space, it's just not very easy to imagine it in a visual manner. On the 2D graph, it was a one-dimensional line that split the data points and allowed us to make predictions against future data points. On the 3D graph, it would be a <em>two</em>-dimensional plane that divides the points. In n-dimensional space, it will be a &quot;hyperplane&quot; (which just means that it is a structure with one less dimension than the space that it exists in). Once you start throwing terms around like &quot;Linear SVM&quot; and &quot;hyperplane&quot;, it's hard <em>not</em> to feel like you're making real progress towards getting a handle on all this machine learning lark! I mention these higher dimensional spaces, though, not just because they sound exciting but because they will be relevant soon..</p>
<p>Something else that's interesting when considering SVMs is that, even with all of the required data, it still might not be possible to delineate the positive and negative results with a linear formula. If we go back to imagining a 2D graph, there could be curious curves in the data that are predictable but can not be cleanly cut with a straight line. In this case, we would have two choices - have the algorithm try to find a line that cuts the results as well as possible (but accept that this will have a lower accuracy because we know that a straight line will get a lot of predictions wrong, based upon the data we've got) or we can allow it to try to come up with a non-linear separation.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/ManagerDecisionHistory-Stricter.jpg" alt="The Stricter Manager's Decision History" /></p>
<p>If, say, you had a manager who leant more towards authorising tasks that had greater strategic value, even if there weren't immediately customers to finance the work (maybe they favour tasks that improve efficiency for work that customers <em>are</em> excited about or maybe it's to lay the groundwork required before customer-led work can continue) then it might not be possible to perfectly fit a straight line to the data. One option, when trying to model this, would be to specify that the learning algorithm could use a non-linear kernel, would would hopefully generate better predictions. <em>Or</em> you could stick with the linear approach and accept that it will be less accurate. Looking at the graph here, there is a curved line that matches the data precisely and there is a straight line that tries its best but can't help splitting the data so that some negative values are above the line (where only positive values should be) and some positive values are below the line (where only negative values should be).</p>
<p>This is another illustration that machine learning can't perform miracles. Before, I described an example where a third feature would need to be added to the data (&quot;available developer resources&quot;) - without which it would be impossible to train a useful model. Here, we can see that sometimes we need to have some insight into what prediction models may or may not work for us (ie. we need to know that a linear kernel won't yield the best results).</p>
<p>I'm not going to dwell on this any longer here because, happily, a linear SVM <em>is</em> a good fit for the data that we'll be working with for classifying face / not-a-face. I don't think that I yet understand enough about the subject to explain <em>why</em> a linear model works so well for what we want to do but I <em>do</em> have links to articles  (which I'll include at the end of this post) that seem happy to explain why this is the case.</p>
<h3>Feature extraction for maybe-a-face images</h3>
<p>So, if an SVM can be trained on pre-existing data and then used to decide whether other data (that it's never seen before) should be classified as a yes or a no, how can this be applied to our &quot;potential face regions&quot;? The first thing that we need to do is decide how to extract features from an image. In the &quot;Manager Decision History&quot; examples above, there were only two or three features but there's nothing stopping us from extracting many more features from our inputs. Whatever we do, though, we need to generate the <em>same</em> number of features for every input into the SVM - so we'll almost certainly have to resize each maybe-a-face sub-image before processing it. We <em>could</em> consider taking all of the pixel data from each resized sub-image (every red value, green value and blue value from every pixel across the entire sub-image).. but we're not going to. Not only would there be a lot of data to work with, there would also be too much variance introduced by the environment of the source photograph. We want to try to give the SVM meaningful data for it to analyse and remove irrelevant variables where possible. By &quot;irrelevant variables&quot;, I mean that it would be great if we could ignore the lighting in an image and focus on the shapes.</p>
<p>Sometimes the lighting varies not just from one image to another but within the same image - if there is a person outside and sunlight falls on one side of them, for example. And it would be great if we could ignore the contrast and the shades of colour - if you can imagine fiddling with an image in Photoshop (or the excellent <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint.NET</a>), recolouring an image or playing with the contrast and brightness doesn't affect your ability to recognise what's in the image (unless you really stretch some of those dials to the max) and we don't want those sorts of differences to have any impact on the SVM's predictions. What we really want is to discount as much of this variance as possible when preparing the inputs (both the inputs used to train it <em>and</em> the subsequent inputs that we want predictions for).</p>
<p>A method that works well to achieve this is to generate normalised &quot;Histograms of Oriented Gradients&quot; from the sub-image. Again, I've come to this conclusion from doing a lot of reading around and then attempting to implement described methods to see how they work - I'll include references to articles with more details at the end of this post.</p>
<p>The premise is fairly simple, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that every image to process is a consistent size before starting (if an image is the wrong aspect ratio for whatever the &quot;consistent size&quot; that you decide on is then add some black bars above-below or left-right, depending upon which sides are too long/short)</li>
<li>Greyscale the image</li>
<li>For every pixel, work out the direction that the intensity of light on the image is changing and how quickly it's changing</li>
<li>Split the data into blocks</li>
<li>Reduce each block into a histogram of gradients</li>
<li>Apply some sort of normalisation to reduce impact of contrast or brightness differences from image to image</li>
<li>Use the resulting data as the image's feature set in the next step!</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that steps 3 and 5 are probably the ones that require further explanation. Since we have a greyscale image by step 3, instead of colour data we effectively have &quot;intensity&quot; values for each pixel. To work out the angle in which the intensity is changing, take the intensity of the pixel below the current one and substract it from the intensity of the pixel above the current one. This is the &quot;y difference&quot; - or &quot;delta y&quot;, so I'll name it &quot;dy&quot; (so that I can sound all maths-y). &quot;dx&quot;, as you can probably imagine, is the difference between the intensity of the pixel to the right minus the intensity of the pixel to the left. We can calculate the angle at which intensity is changing (and how big the change is) with the following:</p>
<pre><code>var angleInDegrees = RadiansToDegrees(Math.Atan2(dx, dy)));
var magnitude = Math.Sqrt((dx * dx) + (dy * dy));
</code></pre>
<p>Note that &quot;Math.Atan2&quot; returns a value in radians. Radians are another unit of measurement of angles but instead of describing a full circle by going from 0-360 degrees, the scale goes from 0-2π radians. So, to convert from radians into easier-to-deal-with-in-this-case degrees we can do this:</p>
<pre><code>private static double RadiansToDegrees(double angle)
{
    return angle * (180d / Math.PI);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also note that Atan2 actually returns values in the range of -π to +π and so calling RadiansToDegrees on the result will give us a value from -180 to +180.</p>
<p><em>(When calculating gradient angles and magnitudes, any pixels on image edges won't have pixels surrounding in every direction and so I just record them as having both an angle and magnitude of zero)</em></p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/HistogramExample.jpg" alt="A Histogram" /></p>
<p>Now for step 5, we want to produce &quot;histograms of oriented gradients&quot; (one for each block that we've split the image into in step 4). I always envisage a histogram like a bar chart - it shows how values are distributed across a range.</p>
<p><em>(The example on the left is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">wikipedia</a> and reproduced here under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">creative commons</a> license)</em></p>
<p>To generate our histograns, we want to assign the gradients with the block across nine buckets, spaced twenty-degrees apart. The first will be at 10 degrees, the second at 30 and they'll go all the way up to 170.</p>
<p>We're going to use &quot;unsigned gradients&quot;, which means that if we have a gradient where intensity is changing only vertically, we don't really care if it's getting brighter as it goes down or brighter as it goes up, we only care that the line is precisely vertical. Similarly, imagine the intensity increasing up-and-right, at 45 degrees - we're happy to treat this the same as intensity going in precisely the opposite direction; down-and-left and 225 degrees (or -135 degrees since our current angleInDegrees values are in the -180 to +180 range). What this essentially means is that we want to tweak our angles so that they are all within 0-180 (instead of -180 to +180). To do, so we just add 180 degrees to any values less than zero.</p>
<p>Every gradient needs to be assigned to one or more of these buckets. If a gradient's angle is precisely 10 degrees then the entirety of the gradient's magnitude is added to the 10 bucket. However, if it's between 10 and 30 then its magnitude is split proportionally between 10 and 30 (so a gradient of 20 degrees is split evenly between 10 and 30 while a gradient of 25 degrees will contribute 3/4 of its magnitude to the 30 bucket - which it is 5 degrees away from - and 1/4 of its magnitude to the 10 bucket - which it is 15 degrees away from).</p>
<p>Performing this transformation on the image is an effective way of reducing the amount of data that we need to deal with. If we decide that the standardised size of the images that we want an SVM to classify is 128x128 then we 128 x 128 x 3 = 49,152 values (since every pixel has three colour values; red, green and blue). If use a block size of 8 when generating the HOG data then the 128 x 128 image will be 16 x 16 blocks and each block has 9 values (since each histogram has values in nine bins), which gives a total of 2,304 values.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about this representation of the data is that, if you sort of squint, you can <em>kind of</em> make out the shapes that were in the source image -</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/HOG-EggMan.jpg" alt="Histogram of gradients render for Egg Man's face" /></p>
<p>If you get curious and want to try generating HOGs for your own images, there is code in my <a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition">my GitHub project</a> to do this..</p>
<pre><code>using (var image = new Bitmap(imagePath))
{
    using (var resizedImage = new Bitmap(image, new Size(128, 128)))
    {
        // (Can ignore GetFor's return value when only interested in generating a preview image)
        FaceClassifier.FeatureExtractor.GetFor(
            resizedImage,
            blockSize: 8,
            optionalHogPreviewImagePath: &quot;HOG.png&quot;,
            normaliser: GlobalNormaliser.Normalise
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>.. which brings me neatly on to HOG normalisation (since there's a mysterious reference to a normaliser in the code above). When the gradient magnitudes are calculated, some images may have many pixels that vary wildly in intensity from their neighbours while other images may have smoother, gentler gradients. In both cases, it is the relative flow of intensity that is important, since that helps identify the shapes. If you took an image and produced HOG data for it and then increased the contrast of the image and re-processed it, you would get greater gradient magnitude values in the increased-constrast version of the image, even though they both - so far as we are interested (in the context of trying to detect faces) - contain exactly the same information.</p>
<p>What we want to do is to align all of the magnitudes to a common base line. A simple (and fairly effective) way to do this is to find the largest value of any of the buckets across all of the histograms generated for an image and to then divide <em>every</em> magnitude by this value. In the example above, the 128x128 input image is transformed into 16x16 blocks, each of which is a histogram that contains 9 values. So we get the largest value from each of those 16x16x9 values and then divide all of them by it. This means that the largest value is now precisely 1.0 and every other value is somewhere between zero and one. This is what the &quot;GlobalNormaliser.Normalise&quot; delegate in the code above does. All it essentially has to do is this:</p>
<pre><code>public static DataRectangle&lt;HistogramOfGradient&gt; Normalise(DataRectangle&lt;HistogramOfGradient&gt; hogs)
{
    if (hogs == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(hogs));

    var maxMagnitude = hogs.Enumerate()
        .Select(pointAndHistogram =&gt; pointAndHistogram.Item2)
        .Max(histogram =&gt; histogram.GreatestMagnitude);
    return hogs.Transform(hog =&gt; hog.Multiply(1 / maxMagnitude));
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, there is a variation on this that has been found to produce more accurate results; &quot;block normalisation&quot;. The original description of this process comes from (as I understand it) the original research into using HOGs for this form of detection (&quot;<a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf">Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection [PDF]</a>&quot;) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For better invariance to illumination, shadowing, etc., it is also useful to contrast-normalize the local<br />
responses before using them. This can be done by accumulating a measure of local histogram “energy” over somewhat larger spatial regions (“blocks”) and using the results to normalize all of the cells in the block</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means in practical terms is explained well by one of the articles that I linked earlier (&quot;<a href="http://mccormickml.com/2013/05/09/hog-person-detector-tutorial/">HOG Person Detector Tutorial</a>&quot;). In essence, it means that we can get better results from normalising over smaller areas of the image. Instead of taking the max magnitude across the entire set of data, the idea is to group the histograms into blocks of four and normalising over those.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Tiger Woods' face to illustrate what I mean.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/TigerWoods-Block1.jpg" alt="First 2x2 block of histograms to normalise" /><br />
<img src="/Content/Images/Posts/TigerWoods-Block2.jpg" alt="Second 2x2 block of histograms to normalise" /></p>
<p>We first take the 2x2 histograms from the top left of the image - we get the max magnitude from within those four histograms and use it to normalise the values within them. These four normalised histograms will provide the first sets of values that we extract from the image.</p>
<p>Then we move across one to get another set of 2x2 histograms and repeat the process; get the max magnitude from within those four histograms, use it to normalise them and then take those four normalised histograms as the next set of values that we have extracted from the image.</p>
<p>What you might notice here is that, as we look at the 2x2 blocks of histograms, some of them will appear multiple times. The histograms from the edges of the image won't but the others <em>will</em>. In the Tiger images here, you can see that the two histograms at the right hand side of the block in the first image are included <em>again</em> in the second image (now they are the two histograms on the left hand side of the block).</p>
<p>This means that this &quot;block normalisation&quot; process will result in more data being produced. When we &quot;globally normalised&quot; the HOGs then we had 16x16x9 = 2,304 values. However, if we block-normalise (using blocks of 2x2) then we generate 30 blocks across (there are two edge blocks that are only counted once but the other 14 blocks are all counted twice, so the total is 2 + (14*2) = 30). For the same reason, we will generate 30 blocks worth of data as we go <em>down</em> the image. This means that we end up with a total of 30x30x9 = 8,100 values.</p>
<p>To extract those features, we would tweak the code from before -</p>
<pre><code>const int inputWidth = 128;
const int inputHeight = 128;
const int blockSizeForHogGeneration = 8;
const int blockSizeForLocalNormalisation = 2;

IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; features;
using (var image = new Bitmap(imagePath))
{
    using (var resizedImage = new Bitmap(image, new Size(inputWidth, inputHeight)))
    {
        var blockNormaliser = new OverlappingBlockwiseNormaliser(blockSizeForLocalNormalisation);
        features = FaceClassifier.FeatureExtractor.GetFor(
            resizedImage,
            blockSize: blockSizeForHogGeneration,
            optionalHogPreviewImagePath: null,
            normaliser: blockNormaliser.Normalise
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>(Note that I'm setting &quot;optionalHogPreviewImagePath&quot; to null so that &quot;FeatureExtractor.GetFor&quot; doesn't generate a &quot;HOG preview&quot; image - this is because it's much harder to recognise the shapes that the gradients were extracted from when this form of normalisation is use since most of the HOGs appear multiple times, so the preview images are of less interest)</em></p>
<p>When I tried comparing the results of global normalisation vs block normalisation, I found that I got better result (ie. better accuracy) when using block normalisation, just as the authors of  &quot;Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection&quot; did. The number of images that I've been testing with is, I'm sure, much smaller than the number used by Dalal and Triggs in their research but it was gratifying that I could see improvementswith my data set from using block normalisation - if only because it reassured me that I was moving in the right direction!</p>
<h3>Training an SVM</h3>
<p>It's really coming together now. We've got a way to extract data from an image that we will be able to pass to an SVM in order for it to classify the image as &quot;face&quot; or &quot;not face&quot;. There's just one thing that we're missing.. a trained SVM. Or, another way to look at it, <em>two</em> things we're missing - a mechanism to train an SVM and the data to train it with.</p>
<p>Let's start with a general way to train an SVM. For this, I'm going to use a package called <a href="http://accord-framework.net/">Accord.NET</a>. It's a library entirely written in C#, which was a plus to me because I like to see how things work and when I was doing my early reading around on the subject of face detection/recognition, a lot of people were recommending <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>. This is a C++ library (which can be called by C# using a .NET wrapper called <a href="http://www.emgu.com">Emgu</a>), while I would be happier with C# source code that I could more confidently dig around in. (Also, I'm toying with the idea of trying to port some of this work to a <a href="http://bridge.net/">Bridge.NET</a> project so that I can try making it work in the browser - this wouldn't be possible if I took a dependency on a library like OpenCV).</p>
<p>Accord.NET really does make it easy.. once you know where to get started. There are a lot of examples on the <a href="http://accord-framework.net/samples.html">accord-framework.net</a> site and on the <a href="https://github.com/accord-net/framework/wiki/Getting%20started">GitHub wiki</a>, though some of the code samples are out of date and will generate compile warnings if you try to use them directly. (Having said that, the warnings <em>can</em> be ignored and it's not too hard to find other examples that compile without warnings - and, from reading some of the GitHub issues, I know that César is aware that some of the docs need updating and is intending to do so when he can make time).</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let's revisit the &quot;Manager Decision History&quot; example from earlier. We'll formulate some example data where we pretend that the Manager is <em>super</em>-consistent and will always authorise work if the percentage that the customer will pay for immediately (as a value between 0 and 1) plus the strategic value (also somehow quantified as a value from 0 to 1) add up to more than 1. (So strategic value 0.9 plus customer-will-pay-immediately 0.2 will be authorised as 0.9 + 0.2 &gt; 1 but strategic value 0.8 with customer-will-pay-immediately of 0.15 will <em>not</em> be authorised as 0.8 + 0.15 &lt; 1). We can then use that data to train an SVM and then try other values against the model -</p>
<pre><code>// Make up some data (in the real world we'd use some proper pre-classified training
// data but this is just an example to demonstate how to train an SVM using Accord.NET)
var decisionHistory = Enumerable.Range(0, 10).Select(x =&gt; x / 10d)
    .SelectMany(x =&gt; Enumerable.Range(0, 10).Select(y =&gt; y / 10d).Select(y =&gt; new
    {
        StrategicValue = x,
        ImmediateCustomerContribution = y,
        Authorised = (x + y) &gt; 1
    }));

// From the data, extract the input features (strategic-value and amount-customer-will-
// pay-now)..
var inputs = decisionHistory
    .Select(decision =&gt; new[]
    {
        decision.StrategicValue,
        decision.ImmediateCustomerContribution
    })
    .ToArrary();

// .. and the true/false outputs for each of those sets of features
var outputs = decisionHistory.Select(decision =&gt; decision.Authorised).ToArray();

// Then use the inputs and outputs to train an SVM
var smo = new SequentialMinimalOptimization&lt;Linear&gt;();
var svm = smo.Learn(inputs, outputs);
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>SequentialMinimalOptimization</strong> defines the process by which it will be decided when the best match has been found for the data that it's been provided. We're specified that a linear kernel be used, which means that we're presuming that it will be possible to neatly classify our data with a straight line.</p>
<p>Now that it's been trained, we can ask the SVM to predict an output by calling its &quot;Decide&quot; method and giving it a pair of values -</p>
<pre><code>var easyWin = svm.Decide(new[] { 0.81, 0.79 });
</code></pre>
<p>This returns true - which is what we would expect since the numbers indicate a feature that has high strategic value (0.81) <em>and</em> there are customers who want it so much <em>right now</em> that they are already getting their chequebooks out (the customer-will-immediately-pay value is 79%).</p>
<pre><code>var lowPriority = svm.Decide(new[] { 0.26, 0.14 });
</code></pre>
<p>This returns false - which we'd also expect, since the numbers indicate a feature of low strategic value and one that no customer is excited about contributing much towards the development cost of.</p>
<p>Time for another gotcha. We saw earlier that a linear kernel is not always going to be capable of perfectly classifying the results in the training data. Sometimes you might need to use a non-linear kernel (or stick with a linear kernel but accept a lower accuracy). I didn't talk about what other kernel options there are (because it's not relevant to what I want to do here) but it was an important point that machine learning will sometimes need some external insight in order to be as effective as it can be. Another example of this is that sometimes you need to tweak the training parameters, depending upon the data that you're using. In the below example, I'm going to try to train an SVM in a very similar manner to what we just looked at, but with much less data -</p>
<pre><code>var decisionHistory  = new[]
{
    // Strategic wins
    new { StrategicValue = 0.95, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.1, Authorised = true },
    new { StrategicValue = 0.85, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.2, Authorised = true },

    // Customer wins
    new { StrategicValue = 0.15, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.9, Authorised = true },
    new { StrategicValue = 0.2, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.9, Authorised = true },

    // Everybody is happy
    new { StrategicValue = 0.8, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.8, Authorised = true },

    // Low priority
    new { StrategicValue = 0.2, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.1, Authorised = false },
    new { StrategicValue = 0.4, ImmediateCustomerContribution = 0.2, Authorised = false }
};

var inputs = decisionHistory
    .Select(decision =&gt; new[]
    {
        decision.StrategicValue,
        decision.ImmediateCustomerContribution
    })
    .ToArrary();

var outputs = decisionHistory.Select(decision =&gt; decision.Authorised).ToArray();

var smo = new SequentialMinimalOptimization&lt;Linear&gt;();
var svm = smo.Learn(inputs, outputs);
</code></pre>
<p>The training data is very similar to before in that all authorised decisions still have a feature sum of more than 1 and all rejected decisions have a sum of 1 or less. However, something seems to have gone wrong because when I ask the trained SVM what it thinks of the &quot;lowPriority&quot; example -</p>
<pre><code>var lowPriority = svm.Decide(new[] { 0.26, 0.14 });
</code></pre>
<p>.. it returns true! This is not what I want.</p>
<p>The only way that this could happen is if the prediction model that has been generated is completely wonky somehow. To put this to the test, I'm going to use a mechanism that Accord has where you can double-check your trained SVM by running the training data back through it to see how well the prediction model managed to fit it. This can be useful in cases where you're not sure if the SVM kernel that you're using is appropriate, since it can highlight a badly-fitting model. To calculate the error rate when the training data is passed back through the SVM, do the following:</p>
<pre><code>var predicted = svm.Decide(inputs);
var error = new ZeroOneLoss(outputs).Loss(predicted);
</code></pre>
<p>This just uses the model to calculate a prediction for each of the inputs and then compares the results to the expected values (then it works out what proportion are incorrect). In this case, the error rate is 0.2857142857142857, which is 2/7. Looking at the predicted values (an array of bool), every value is true! This isn't right, the last two inputs (the &quot;low priority&quot; data points) should result in a false prediction. I guess that that explains why the &quot;lowPriority&quot; example returns true from this model - it seems to return for <em>everything</em>!</p>
<p>We know that a linear model <em>will</em> fit this data because we know that it's a straight line on a graph that separates everything above 1 (which are &quot;decision authorised&quot; results) from everything else (which are &quot;decision rejected&quot; results). So it's not the kernel that's the problem. The only other thing to do is to look for some options to fiddle with. Poring through the documentation, one that sounds promising is &quot;Complexity&quot; (also referred to as &quot;cost&quot;) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost parameter C controls the trade off between allowing training errors and forcing rigid margins. It creates a soft margin that permits some misclassifications. Increasing the value of C increases the cost of misclassifying points and forces the creation of a more accurate model that may not generalize well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That description makes it sound like a bad thing to try increasing the complexity, I think I <em>want</em> a model that will generalise well. However, leaving the complexity at its default is clearly not working well for us in this case. So, I tried changing the <strong>SequentialMinimalOptimization</strong> initialisation to:</p>
<pre><code>var smo = new SequentialMinimalOptimization&lt;Linear&gt; { Complexity = 10 };
</code></pre>
<p>.. and re-running. This time, the predicted array precisely matched the output array, which means that the error rate is now zero. When I ask the new model to predict a value for the &quot;lowPriority&quot; features, it returns false - which is much better!</p>
<p>I've only experienced this problem when working with small amounts of data. To train a face classification SVM, we're going to throw a lot of training data at it and so this shouldn't be a problem (there will be no need to fiddle with Complexity or any other settings). I only mention it now in case you decide to do a few experiments of your own and fall into the same trap that I did!</p>
<h3>Training data for faces</h3>
<p>We have all the tools that we need now, the final piece of the puzzle is that we need training data to teach an SVM what looks like a face and what doesn't.</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> take the pictures that I found on my computer, run them through the skin tone face detector, manually categorise each maybe-a-face region and then use that information to train an SVM. I would use the HOG feature extractor to generate the training inputs and the list of output values would be the manual classifications that I would have to prepare (eg. sub-image-1 is a face, sub-image-2 is not a face, etc..). This should result in an SVM that could them tell apart each of the sub images automatically. However, that would be cheating! What I want to do is train a classifier with one lot of data and then use the SVM on my Easter Weekend photos to prove that it's worked. (Testing an SVM using the same data used to train it is a bit pointless, it gives you no indication whether you have produced something that is useful for general purpose or if you've only succeeded in training an SVM that is specialised and only works with that particular set of inputs).</p>
<p>It's crucial to train it using both positive images (ie. face images) and negative images (non-face images), otherwise the SVM will have no idea to classify. If, for example, you tried to train an SVM using only positive images then all you teach it is that <em>everything</em> is a positive image! (By always returning true, it would produce a zero error rate for the training data but it's not very useful to alway returns true when trying to classify real work data). So we need both kinds of input and I think that we ideally want to have an equal number of positive and negative images.</p>
<p><em>(If I had to really think about it, maybe it should be the case that we want <strong>at least</strong> as many negative images as positive as there are only so many variations of a face that exist but there are <strong>loads</strong> of things that <strong>aren't</strong> faces.. however, an equal number of positive/negative has worked well for me and so I haven't felt the need to experiment with different ratios)</em></p>
<p>I've found various places that have databases of images of faces but I found it difficult to decide how to get a set of negative images. I'm sure that in some things I read, people spoke about using images of scenery.. but I can't see why there should be any particular kind of negative image (such as scenery) that should be used - it could be <em>anything</em> (so long as it's not a face)!</p>
<p>What I did in the end was download the &quot;<a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech_10K_WebFaces/">Caltech 10,000 Web Faces</a>&quot; data set, which includes lots of photos downloaded from various Google image searches along with a text file that, crucially, has coordinates of the faces in the photos. From this data set, I extracted the faces from images but also extracted other parts of the images at random that <em>didn't</em> contain faces. For each face entry in the &quot;Ground Truth&quot; text file, I extracted three images - one where the edges of the sub-image were close around the face and then two where there was a little more background around the face. This should help produce an SVM that can recognise faces when the region around the face is very tight and when it's less so, which is important for classifying the skin tone face detection results - Tiger Woods' detected-face-region is quite tight while the other photos show that much looser face regions may be identified for other photos.</p>
<p>There's no exciting implementation details here. The &quot;<a href="https://github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition/blob/master/FaceClassifier/CalTechWebFacesSvmTrainer.cs">CalTechWebFacesSvmTrainer</a>&quot; class is given a bunch of configuration options: path containing the CalTech web face images, path to the Ground Truth text file (which lists all of the face regions in the images), standard size of image to use to generate SVM inputs (128x128), block size for HOG generation (8), normaliser (the <strong>OverlappingBlockwiseNormaliser</strong> we saw earlier, with block size 2) and number of training images to process. These options will train an SVM on positive and negative images from the Caltech data set and the &quot;TrainFromCaltechData&quot; method will return an <strong>IClassifyPotentialFaces</strong> implementation, which wraps the SVM and exposes has a single method -</p>
<pre><code>bool IsFace(Bitmap image);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can take the possible-face sub-images identified by the skin tone pass and pass them to &quot;IsFace&quot;. This method will resize the specified Bitmap to the standard image size that the SVM requires, generate normalised HOG data from it and then query the SVM - which returns the final result; <em>is this or is this not a face?</em></p>
<p>The only configuration option that I haven't mentioned until now is &quot;number of training images to process&quot;. We saw before that trying to train an SVM with very little data can be ineffective (unless you know what kernel settings to fiddle with) but it's very difficult to come up with a hard and fast rule of how much data <em>is</em> enough to train from. I think that the best thing to do is just to experiment. My gut told me that it would surely have to be at least 100s or 1000s of images since the SVM has to be trained to classify many variations of faces (and not-faces) and each of the inputs has a lot of values (8,100 - as we calculated earlier) and so it seems like it's going to need to have a lot of information at its disposal so that it can work out what is and isn't important.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/Dancing.jpg" alt="Dancing Classification Fail" /></p>
<p>So, initially, I tried specifying 500 training images, which resulted in an SVM that actually did a pretty good job. The group photo shown before had all of the maybe-face regions correctly classified (the faces were all identified as faces and the hands in the photos were all correctly classified as not-faces).</p>
<p>However, there was a problem with the image shown here (the problem, btw, clearly <em>isn't</em> the moves being thrown on the dancefloor, since they look like the very essence of poetry in motion). The problem is that one of the maybe-face regions identified by the skin tone pass has been mis-classified by the SVM as a face, when it's really an arm.</p>
<p><em>(Note that there are some faces in the background that were not identified by the skin tone pass, but I'm not worried about that - it is to be expected that they would be ignored because they are small, relative to the size of the image.. though it should be possible to tweak the skin tone filter parameters if you wanted to try to capture background faces).</em></p>
<p>Increasing the number of training images to 1,000 didn't address the problem with this particular image and, in fact, made another image worse (where a non-face region was correctly classifed as not-a-face before, with 1,000 training images the SVM thought that it <em>was</em> a face). Increasing to 1,500 training images corrected the classification of the dancing image regions but there were still false positives in other images. Such as this one of that same individual who appears to now be wearing a flag (which reminds me of a scene from <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em>).</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/FlagWearer.jpg" alt="Another Classification Failure" /></p>
<p>2,000 training images seemed to be the sweet spot. The classifier produced the correct results for every case that I expected it to.</p>
<p>The quantity of training data is going to vary from application to application and will depend upon what sort of feature extraction logic you are using. I think that it makes sense to start with lower quantities, if only because it's faster to train an SVM with less data and you can experiment more quickly with the other variables. To illustrate, on my computer (with the code as it currently stands, which is in a completely unoptimised state, but running a release build) it takes 17s to load the 2,000 images and extract the features from them, it then takes 27s to train the SVM on them. With 500 images it takes 5s to load the image data and 2s to train the SVM. With 5,000 images it takes 42s and 168s.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/EggMan-Final.jpg" alt="Egg Man's Glorious Face" /></p>
<p>There's one final tweak that I'd like to mention before bringing everything to a close. The SVM requires that the inputs be fixed dimensions, so the &quot;IsFace&quot; implementation resizes the input image if it's too big or too small. If it's the wrong <em>dimensions</em>, though, then it leaves black bars above-and-below or left-and-right of the input (which is part of the process that I described in &quot;Feature extraction for maybe-a-face images&quot;). I found that the classification accuracy improved slightly if I expanded the maybe-a-face region so that it matched the aspect ratio of the SVM's input dimensions first. For example, if the skin tone pass identified a face region that was 91x241px and I knew that the SVM was configured to work with input images of 128x128px then I would first expand the 91x241px region to 241x241px (similarly, if I had a region that was 123x56px then I would expand it to 123x123px).</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>In the context of this kind of work, &quot;performance&quot; relates to two distinct areas - how <em>accurately</em> does it perform its work and how <em>quickly</em> does it do it? To an extent, the two are related since we could make the skin tone filter work more quickly (if we reduced the limit from no-input-dimension-may-be-more-than-400px to 300px or 200px) but at the risk of it no longer identifying regions that we want it to. As we've just seen with the SVM training, the time it takes to train it depends upon the quantity of data (both the size of the input image that features are extracted from and the number of input images) - so the inputs could be reduced (so that the training time would be shorter) but this negatively affects the accuracy of the classifier.</p>
<p><em>(A handy tip that I used when I was happy with the SVM training but experimenting with the skin tone pass was that the Accord.NET SVM class may be serialised using the BinaryFormatter - so I was persisting it to disk between runs, rather than having to re-train it on every run)</em></p>
<p>Once the SVM is trained, it is very quick at classifying. Which makes sense, since all it needs to do is take a feature set, apply its linear formula and see which side of the hyperplane the data point sits on. There is a little work required to extract the feature data from a maybe-face sub-image in order to give the SVM something to work on but it takes less then 15ms per sub-image on my computer. The skin tone pass is slower, taking between 150 and 300ms for the images that I've been testing with (which are all about 1000px on the largest side and so are resized down to 400px before being processed). I'd like to cut this time down because I like the idea of being able to apply this processing to video and I feel that it needs to be able to process at least five frames a second to convincingly track faces. I haven't made any effort towards this yet but reducing the total time down to 200ms feels reasonable since the code has been written to be easy to follow and tweak, rather than to be fast, so there is surely plenty of performance tuning potential.</p>
<p>Another reason that I haven't spent any time optimising the current code is that it might be wiser to spend time researching alternative algorithms. For example, Accord.NET has some support for face detection, such as the <strong>FaceHaarCascade</strong> class (which I believe is the same class of detector as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework">Viola–Jones object detection framework</a>) -</p>
<pre><code>Rectangle[] faceRegions;
using (var image = new Bitmap(path))
{
    var detector = new HaarObjectDetector(new FaceHaarCascade());
    faceRegions = detector.ProcessFrame(image);
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, it gave poor results for my images. It seemed to do well with very small faces but struggled with  larger images (or the images where the faces took up a large proportion of the image). It's very possible that I could improve the accuracy by tweaking the parameters. If my images are too large, maybe they should just be shrunk down further before processing? That might help the false negative rate but I'm also concerned about the false positive rate and I'm not sure that shrinking the image first would help with that.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/TigerWoods-SlidingWindow.jpg" alt="TigerWoods - Sliding Window SVM Results" /></p>
<p>One approach that sounds very promising: if the SVM classifier is so fast and effective then maybe we should get rid of the skin tone processing altogether and just generate segments from all over the image, then filter them with the classifier. This is discussed and recommended by many people and is referred to as the &quot;sliding window&quot; approach (see <a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/23/sliding-windows-for-object-detection-with-python-and-opencv/">Sliding Windows for Object Detection with Python and OpenCV</a>, for example). The idea is that you pick a window size (eg. 50px if limiting the source image to no more than 400px on a side) and then start at the top left of the image and take that top-left 50x50px as the first sub-image to pass to the classifer. Then you move the window over a bit (say, 10px) and then use that as the second sub-image. Keep going until you can't go any further and then go back to the left but go down 10px - moving across then back-and-down until you have covered the entire image. Then do the same with some other window sizes (maybe 75px and then 100px), since you don't know whether the faces on an image are going to be small (relative to the size of the image) or large. This will give you many, <em>many</em> regions to classify - but that's no problem because linear SVM classification is very fast. Unfortunately, I did try this but I got an enormous false positive rate (as you can see here with Tiger - if you can make him out from behind all the green &quot;this is a face!&quot; boxes). Surely this approach <em>can</em> be made to work since it's so commonly presented as a solution to this problem.. it may just be that I need to tweak how the SVM is trained, maybe it needs more than 2,000 training images (though I did also try it with 10,000 training images and the results were not much better).</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/BlackAndWhiteFaceFails.jpg" alt="Black and White Face Detection Fail" /></p>
<p>To return to the performance of the skin-tone-pass-following-by-(2k-image-trained-)SVM-classification model that I've talked about for most of this post; in terms of accuracy I'm very happy with it. In the test images that I've been using, there are zero false positives. There are a couple of false negatives but I think that they are understandable. The first obvious failing that it has is with a black-and-white photo - since the skin tone face detector looks for particular hues and saturations, it's not going to work on if there is no colour in the image. That's just a built-in limitation of the approach.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/OccludedFace.jpg" alt="Semi-occluded" /></p>
<p>Another failure is with a face that is half hidden behind someone else (in the top right of this group photo). The skin tone face detector identifies the face but the SVM classifies it as not-a-face. Since the face is half-hidden, I think that this is acceptable.</p>
<p><img src="/Content/Images/Posts/VomitSkinMask.jpg" alt="Vomit shot with skin mask" /><br />
<img src="/Content/Images/Posts/VomitFalseNegative.jpg" alt="Vomit shot false negative" /></p>
<p>Last but not least is this unfortunate guy who foolishly entered some sort of drinking contest. I don't know if he won but he doesn't look too good about it one way or the other. The red liquid erupting from his lips falls within the first phase's looks-like-skin-tones bounds, as you can see by looking at the skin mask image. Not only is his head tilted in the shot but the vomit-detected-as-skin means that his face isn't centered in the maybe-face region. So I'm not surprised that the SVM doesn't correctly classify it.</p>
<p>In summary, it's not perfect but I'm still very happy with the results.</p>
<h3>Article references</h3>
<p>I want to close this post off by linking to the sites and papers that helped me get to this point. It's been a fun journey and is hopefully only my first step on the machine learning track!</p>
<p>The &quot;<a href="http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/naked-skin.html">Naked People Skin Filter (Fleck &amp; Forsyth)</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090723024922/http:/geocities.com/jaykapur/face.html">Face Detection in Color Images</a>&quot; papers were amongst the first that I found that had easily understandable material (for a face detection novice) that didn't use a third party library in some way.</p>
<p>Once I had implemented the skin tone logic and was looking to improve the results, one of the articles that I found most inspiring (partly because it was so approachable) was &quot;<a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78#.v32w6yht7">Machine Learning is Fun! Part 4: Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning</a>&quot; (by Adam Geitgey). This talks about taking things to the next step and performing facial <em>recognition</em> - not just locating faces but also trying to identify who they are, against a known database. I haven't got to that advanced point yet but it's definitely something that I'd like to explore. The only thing that I would say about this article is that it doesn't go into a lot of depth about generating HOGs or normalising them or what sort of input image size and other parameters to use. He does link to some Python code that uses third party libraries in lieu of more details, though. Since I wanted to write C# and (ideally) only take C# dependencies this wasn't very helpful to me. The article itself, though, got me really excited about the possibilities and I enjoyed the guy's writing style (and intend to read the rest of his &quot;Machine Learning is Fun&quot; series).</p>
<p>An article that <em>did</em> go into the details was the &quot;<a href="http://mccormickml.com/2013/05/09/hog-person-detector-tutorial/">HOG Person Detector Tutorial</a>&quot; (by Chris McCormick). This was also really well written and very approachable. Although it talks about detecting a person in a photo, rather than a face, the principles are the same. The description of the HOG generation and normalisation really helped me clarify in my mind how it should all work. This article links to the original <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf">HOG person detector paper by Dalal and Triggs [PDF]</a>, which is full of research information and graphs and equations - so if you want to dig deep then this is the place to start!</p>
<p>The Triggs and Dalal paper state in the introduction that &quot;For simplicity and speed, we use linear SVM as a baseline classifier throughout the study&quot;. Later on they mention that they tried a non-linear kernel but that &quot;Replacing the linear SVM with a Gaussian kernel one improves performance by about 3%.. at the cost of much higher run times&quot;. If this &quot;why is a linear SVM classifier appropriate&quot; explanation feels too light for you then it is discussed in greater depth in &quot;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2419.pdf">Why do linear SVMs trained on HOG features perform so well? [PDF]</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention again the article &quot;<a href="http://crsouza.com/2010/04/27/kernel-support-vector-machines-for-classification-and-regression-in-c/">Kernel Support Vector Machines for Classification and Regression in C#</a>&quot; by Accord.NET's César Souza. Here, he introduces the SVM in a much more formal way than I've done here, he includes a video about &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3liCbRZPrZA">The Kernel Trick</a>&quot; (which is a simple yet mind-blowing way in which the linear kernel can be used to classify data that doesn't immediately look like it would work for), he talks about other kernels (aside from linear he also describes polynomial and gaussian) and he describes how the Sequential Minimal Optimization learning algorithm works. There's a lot of code and there's illustrated examples at the end. When I found this article fairly early on in my research, I recognised how much care had gone into preparing it but also knew that I needed something a little more beginner-level first! So I bookmarked it for future reference and now I think that I understand (almost all of) it. Hopefully, if you started off knowing nothing but have followed all the way through this post, then you will too!</p>
